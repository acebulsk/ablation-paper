<!-- **Abstract:** Existing canopy snow ablation parameterisations have been shown to have uncertain transferability across differing climate and forest types. Moreover, many of the theories underlying the existing parameterisations have not been tested extensively across climate and forest types. Here, novel snow interception process understanding, developed from fine-scale and high-frequency observations collected from needleleaf forests in the Canadian Rockies, is used to decouple the processes that initially load snow in the canopy from those that ablate it. A revised snow interception parameterisation that calculates throughfall as a function of forest structure, is presented with modified canopy snow ablation parameterisations, and implemented in the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform to simulate canopy snow load and subcanopy snowpack dynamics. To assess the effectiveness of these new parameterisations, simulations using both new and traditional routines were evaluated against observations of subcanopy snow water equivalent and canopy snow load at sites not used in model development, including the continental climate Marmot Creek, Alberta; subarctic climate Wolf Creek, Yukon Territory; and coastal climate Russell Creek, British Columbia (all in  Canada). Preliminary results show that the revised interception parameterisation improves predictability, increasing the R2 compared to measurements from 0.4 with existing methods to 0.7 with the revised routine. This improved process understanding of snow interception and canopy snow ablation processes may have broad applicability and reliability, improving water resource assessment of forested, snow-dominated basins. -->

<!-- Thesis outline: -->

<!--  Previous studies have developed parameterisations to represent ablation processes including unloading, melt, drip and sublimation of snow intercepted in the canopy. However, these parameterisations have been shown to have uncertain transferability to new environments and have not yet been tested in discontinuous forest canopies. This study presents new in-situ measurements of canopy snow ablation processes and contrasts these observations with existing theories and models. Analysis of the canopy snow mass balance showed that unloading, drip and melt contributed to 60% of canopy snow ablation on average over two years with the remainder being attributed to canopy snow sublimation. The probability of unloading, drip and melt was observed to increase with air temperature and wind speed. However, the probability of wind induced unloading was observed to decrease at warmer air temperatures. The probability of unloading due to warming was also observed to decline when wind speeds were above 1 m s-1. The increase in cohesion and adhesion of snow in the canopy at warmer temperatures and cooling due to wind-induced evaporation may contribute to the interaction multivariate interaction between air temperature, wind speed and canopy snow unloading. Exponential relationships were observed between both air temperature and wind speed with unloading and drip, which were also dependent on the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy. In comparison to existing models, this discontinuous forest exhibited unloading and drip due to warming at lower air temperatures. Conversely, wind-induced unloading occurred at higher wind speeds than predicted by current models. -->

# Introduction

<!-- Accurate models of snow accumulation and subsequent streamflow in forested basins rely on a comprehensive understanding of snow interception and canopy snow ablation processes as vegetation cover can reduce snow accumulation by up to 45% through sublimation of snow intercepted in the canopy [@Essery2003; @Sanmiguel-Vallelado2020]. Needleleaf canopies can intercept a large fraction of snowfall [@Storck2002; @Cebulski2025a], which is then partitioned to the atmosphere via sublimation [@Pomeroy1998b; @Parviainen2002] and to the ground through unloading and melt processes [@Storck2002; @Roesch2001; @Lumbrazo2022]. Recent work has revealed the benefits of distinguishing the initial accumulation of snow in the canopy from subsequent ablation processes to accurately simulate snow accumulation in forests [@Cebulski2025; @Cebulski2025b]. Previously initial interception parameterizations were combined with some ablation processes, largely related to the maximum canopy snow load [e.g., @Hedstrom1998; @Andreadis2009], leading to uncertain transferability when combined with other canopy snow ablation parameterizations. Correctly representing these processes is thus crucial for accurately simulating snow accumulation in forested environments and above canopy albedo, a key component of large scale climate models. Still, after separating the initial interception process as in @Cebulski2025b, representing subsequent ablation processes remain uncertain as they have been calibrated to work with an initial accumulation routines that includes some ablation. Moreover, canopy snow unloading parameterisations have shown uncertain transferability across differing climates and forest types [@Lundquist2021; @Lumbrazo2022]; which also been attributed as a key area of uncertainty across many hydrological models [@Rutter2009; @Krinner2018] in model intercomparison studies. This uncertainty in the canopy snow ablation process raises concerns about correctly representing the partitioning of snowfall in forests to the ground versus the atmosphere. For example, an over estimation in the canopy snow unloading rate reduces possible atmospheric losses, and vice versa.  -->

<!-- Ablation of snow intercepted in the canopy as mass clumps of snow, typically referred to as unloading, has been shown to be associated with air temperature [@Roesch2001], ice-bulb temperature, which better represents the cooling effect of sublimation [@Ellis2010; @Floyd2012], canopy snowmelt rate [@Storck2002], and wind speed [@Roesch2001; @Bartlett2015; @Katsushima2023], all of which are also a function of the canopy snow load.  -->

<!-- Melt of snow intercepted in the canopy is represented by an energy balance approach [e.g., @Clark2015b; @Andreadis2009], as a function of air temperature [@Roesch2001], or a function of ice-bulb temperature [@Ellis2010; @Floyd2012].  -->

<!-- Sublimation is represented using an energy balance approach [e.g., @Essery2003; @Verseghy2017] or an analytical parameterisation [@Ellis2010] following @Pomeroy1998b. Both the @Essery2003 and @Pomeroy1998b parameterisation include a resistance term to decrease the latent heat flux from snow intercepted in the canopy as the canopy fills up with snow and its surface area decreases. However, the canopy 'fullness' resistance term is based on earlier estiamtes of the maximum canopy snow load which has shown to be an underestimate in many other areas [@Storck2002; @Lundquist2021; @Cebulski2025a] and should be reconsidered using a larger maximum load.  -->



<!-- - Mention unloading processes included in current models, some developed based on above canopy albedo which is uncertain. -->
<!-- - Snowmelt predicted from an energy balance has not been tested along with melt-induced and wind-driven unloading. -->
<!-- - Few direct measurements of canopy snow ablation available.  -->
<!-- - Limited testing in differing environments and forest types.  -->
<!-- - Comment on canopy snowmelt drip measurements freeze/thaw in the tipping buckets and lysimeters and difficulty in isolating concurrent processes as described in @Storck2002 to provide the justification for simulated canopy snowmelt in the analysis. -->

The objective of this study is to determine if the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions behind existing canopy snow ablation parameterisations are supported by in-situ observations collected from a subalpine forest in the Canadian Rockies. This study specifically looks at canopy snow ablation after snowfall, initial interception has been discussed in @Cebulski2025.

Research Questions:

1. How does air temperature, wind, canopy snow sublimation, and snowmelt influence the rate of canopy snow unloading?

2. To what extent do current theoretical models of canopy snow ablation align with in-situ observations?

3. What modifications of existing models, if any, are necessary to accurately represent ablation of snow intercepted in the canopy and what is the performance of the updated model?

# Study Site and Instrumentation

The observations presented in this study were collected at Fortress Mountain Research Basin (FMRB), AB, -115° W, 51° N, a continental headwater basin in the Canadian Rockies at 2100 m above sea level. Air temperature, humidity, and wind speed were measured at a height of 4.3 m at Forest Tower (FT) Station (@fig-site-map). The precipitation rate was measured by an Alter-shielded OTT Pluvio weighing precipitation gauge installed 2.6 m above ground at Powerline Station. Incoming and outgoing solar radiation was measured by a Kipp & Zonen CNR4 4-Component Net Radiometer installed 3.27 m above the ground at Fortress Ridge Station. Three subcanopy lysimeters, consisting of a plastic horse-watering trough with an opening of 0.9 m^2^ and depth of 20 cm suspended from a load cell, were installed to measure canopy snow unloading. A weighed tree lysimeter (subalpine fir) suspended from a load cell (Artech S-Type 20210-100) measured the weight of canopy snow load (kg) and was scaled to an areal estimate of snow load (mm) using snow surveys as in @Pomeroy1993a. Additional details on this study site and the meteorological and lysimeter measurements have been described in @Cebulski2025a. Four tipping bucket rain gauges, 3 Texas Electronics TR-525M and 1 Hyquest Solutions TB4MM were installed along a 15 m transect adjacent to the dense canopy subcanopy lysimeter to measure canopy snowmelt drainage. To isolate the subcanopy lysimeter measurements of canopy snow unloading from throughfall, 15-min intervals were selected that met the following criteria: no atmospheric precipitation, and snow was observed to be intercepted in the canopy using the weighed tree and timelapse imagery investigation.

A CSAT measured shear stress ... however it was frequently covered with snow during the ablation periods. So to provide a complete record of shear stress, a relationship between wind speed at 4.3 m at FT station and shear stress from the CSAT (see supporting information). Shear stress was then gap filled when the CSAT was covered with snow using this relationship.

# Methods

## Statistics on Canopy Snow Unloading Relationships

### Combined influence of predictors on unloading 

The influence of air temperature, wind speed, snow load, melt, and sublimation on the unloading process was assessed using a multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The analyses tested the following hypotheses:

  a. Melt promotes unloading through loss of structural integrity, particle bond weakening, and lubrication.
  b. Sublimation promotes unloading via structural degradation and bond weakening.
  c. Wind promotes unloading through shear stress on snow, wind erosion, and branch movement.
  d. Air temperature promotes unloading by increased elasticity branches and association with melt/sublimation.

Because many of these processes occur simultaneously and could not be isolated experimentally, different combinations of the independent variables were included in the regression to identify which sets of processes significantly influenced unloading. The subcanopy lysimeter unloading measurements had a high relative instrument error due to the relatively small accumulation of unloaded snow over the 15-min intervals. To improve instrument accuracy, while maintain consistency of the unloading measurements with wind speed, the 15-min interval measurements of unloading were aggregated over differing predictor variable bins. Air temperature and wind speed were measured at FT station, canopy snow load from the weighed tree lysimeter (scaled to the canopy of each respective subcanopy lysimeter), and canopy snowmelt and sublimation simulated in CRHM. Sublimation was simulated using @eq-ql following @Essery2003 and snowmelt calculated using available energy from @eq-eb both implemented in CRHM, were used for this analysis. Bins that had accumulated unloaded snow less than 0.1 mm were removed which resulted in a mean instrument error of +/- 2% for the remaining bins. The individual processes found to be significant predictors of unloading in the multivariate regression (i.e., shear stress and canopy snow melt) were then isolated to parameterise a model of their effects.

### Wind induced unloading

The influence of wind, shear stress and canopy snow load on unloading was assessed during intervals without canopy snowmelt. These periods were defined using simulated canopy snowmelt in CRHM and by visual analysis of time-lapse imagery. By excluding periods influenced by melt, the snow captured by the lysimeters is attributed primarily to wind-driven unloading. Although unloading resulting from snow metamorphism or thermally induced branch bending may also contribute, the observed unloading is interpreted to be predominantly wind-induced over these intervals. The relationship between wind speed, shear stress, canopy snow load, and unloading was analyzed using linear and non-linear least squares regression, with shear stress modelled linearly and wind speed modelled exponentially. The linear relationship between shear stress, canopy load, and unloading did not include an intercept term and was thus the coefficient of determination (*R^2^*) was adjusted following [@Kozak1995].

### Canopy snowmelt induced unloading 

A mass balance approach was incorporated to determine the unloading rate resulting from canopy snowmelt ($q_{unld}^{melt}$, mm s^-1^). The influence of canopy snowmelt on $q_{unld}^{melt}$ was then assessed by fitting a linear model using an ordinary least squares regression. Since direct measurements of canopy snow unloading are challenging to obtain independently from canopy snowmelt drainage [@Storck2002], the following mass balance was incorporated to determine $q_{unld}^{melt}$ as a residual:

$$
\frac{dL}{dt} = 
[q_{sf} - q_{tf} + q_{ros}] - [q_{unld}^{melt} + q_{unld}^{wind}] - q_{drip} - q_{wind}^{veg} - q_{sub}^{veg}
$$ {#eq-canopy-mass-bal}

where $\frac{dL}{dt}$ is the change in canopy snow load over time, (mm s^-1^), $q_{sf}$ is the snowfall rate (mm s^-1^), $q_{tf}$ (mm s^-1^) is the throughfall rate (mm s^-1^), $q_{ros}$ (mm s^-1^) is the rate of rainfall falling on snow intercepted in the canopy, $q_{unld}^{melt}$ is the canopy snow unloading rate due to melt (mm s^-1^), $q_{unld}^{wind}$ is the canopy snow unloading rate due to wind (mm s^-1^), $q_{drip}$ is the canopy snow drip rate resulting from canopy snowmelt (mm s^-1^), $q_{wind}^{veg}$ is the wind transport rate in or out of the control volume (mm s^-1^), and $q_{sub}^{veg}$ is the intercepted snow sublimation rate (mm s^-1^). Figure 1 in @Cebulski2025 presents a visual representation of this mass balance. Little research has examined the the water-holding capacity of snow intercepted in the canopy; however in this study it is assumed to be minimal such that $q_{drip} \approx q_{melt}$.

Then @eq-canopy-mass-bal was rearranged to solve for $q_{unld}^{melt}$ during intervals without $[q_{sf} - q_{tf} + q_{ros}]$ or $q_{wind}^{veg}$ as:

$$
q_{unld}^{melt} = -\frac{dL}{dt} - q_{drip} - q_{unld}^{wind} - q_{sub}^{veg}
$${#eq-unld-melt-mass-bal}

While some components of the canopy snow mass balance can be measured directly with relative ease, such as $\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta t}$ with the weighed tree, sublimation of canopy snow is more difficult to quantify directly especially in forested mountain environments [@Helgason2012b; @Conway2018] and thus $q_{sub}^{veg}$ was simulated in this study in CRHM using @eq-ql as described in @Essery2003. $q_{drip}$ was measured where possible using the tipping buckets, however problems with freezing of liquid water in the devices limited the amount of $q_{drip}$ that could be collected. Thus, $q_{drip}$ was also supplemented with simulated canopy snowmelt ($q_{melt}$) in CRHM as in @eq-eb. Canopy snow ablation periods that were dominated by melt were selected for calculating $q_{unld}^{melt}$ where the contribution of $q_{unld}^{wind}$ and $q_{sub}^{veg}$ to canopy snow ablation was less than 5%. 

# Canopy Snow Energy Balance 

A revised canopy snow energy balance is presented here which provided both an approximation of canopy snowmelt and sublimation as these processes could not be measured directly and also for use in the canopy snow ablation routines. The energy available for melting snow intercepted in the canopy, $Q_{melt}$ (W m^-2^), which is a function of the canopy snow load ($L$) was calculated as:

$$
Q_{melt}(L) = 
Q_{sw} +
Q_{lw} +
Q_{p} + Q_{h} + Q_{l} - [C_p^{ice} L \frac{\Delta T_{vs}}{\Delta t}]
$$ {#eq-eb}

where $Q_{sw}$ and $Q_{lw}$ (W m^-2^) are the net shortwave and longwave radiation heat fluxes to the canopy snow, $Q_p$ (W m^-2^), is the advective energy rate, and $Q_{l}$ and $Q_{h}$ (W m^-2^), are the turbulent fluxes of latent heat and sensible heat respectively (positive towards canopy snow), $C_p^{ice}$ (J kg^-1^ K^-1^) is the specific heat capacity of ice, and $\frac{\Delta T_{vs}}{\Delta t}$ (K s^-1^) is the change in canopy snow temperature over time. 

$Q_{sw}$ was determined as:

$$
Q_{sw} = \downarrow Q_{sw} \cdot (1 - \alpha_s) \cdot \tau_{50}^{veg}
$$ {#eq-sw}

where $\downarrow Q_{sw}$ is the downwelling shortwave radiation (W m^-2^), $\alpha_s$ is the albedo of snow intercepted in the canopy (-), $\tau_{50}^{veg}$ (-) is the canopy transmittance to $\downarrow Q_{sw}$. $\tau_{50}^{veg}$ was determined using Equation from @Pomeroy2009 with half of the leaf area index (LAI), following studies [@Weiskittel2009; @Kesselring2024], who report that approximately 50% of the total leaf area is concentrated in the upper half of coniferous canopies. This provides an approximation of the mean $Q_{sw}$ to all snow intercepted in the canopy, and is a simplification from using a partial differential equation to determine the radiation incident to individual height layers within the canopy. Upwelling shortwave radiation reflected off of the surface snowpack is considered negligible contribution to the snow intercepted in the canopy as it is primarily blocked by vegetation elements underlying the canopy snow. 

$Q_{lw}$ was approximated as:

$$
Q_{lw} = \downarrow Q_{lw}^{atm} + \uparrow Q_{lw}^{veg} + \uparrow Q_{lw}^{veg2veg} - Q_{lw}^{vs}
$$ {#eq-lw}

where $Q_{lw}^{atm}$ is the downwelling longwave radiation from the atmosphere (W m^-2^), $Q_{lw}^{veg}$ is the longwave radiation upwelling from vegetation elements underlying snow intercepted in the canopy (W m^-2^), $Q_{lw}^{veg2veg}$ is the downwelling longwave radiation emitted from the underside of the vegetation elements reflected by the subcanopy snowpack (W m^-2^), and $Q_{lw}^{vs}$ (W m^-2^) is the outgoing longwave radiation from the top and bottom of the canopy snow layer calculated as:

$$
Q_{lw}^{vs} = 2 \epsilon_{s} \sigma T_{vs}^4
$$ {#eq-lw-vs}

where $\epsilon_s$ is the emissivity (-) of snow taken as 0.99 and $\sigma$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann (5.67e-10 W m^-1^ K^-4^). $Q_{lw}^{atm}$ was approximated in this study as in @Sicart2006 to take into account the influence of atmospheric moisture on emissivity. $Q_{lw}^{veg}$ was calculated with the assumption that canopy elements were in equilibrium with the air temperature plus any change in vegetation temperature from the extinction of $\downarrow Q_{sw}$ in the canopy [@Pomeroy2009, Eq. 4].

$Q_p$ was calculated as:

$$
Q_p = [C_p^{wtr} m_r(T_r - T_{vs}) + C_p^{ice} m_s(T_s - T_{vs})] / \Delta t
$$ {#eq-qp}

where $C_p^{wtr}$ is the specific heat capacity of water (J kg^-1^ K^-1^), $m_r$ is the specific mass of liquid water in precipitation (mm), $T_r$ is the rainfall temperature (K), $m_s$ is the specific mass of snow in precipitation (mm), and $T_s$ is the snowfall temperature (K). 

$Q_h$ was calculated as:

$$
Q_h = \frac{\rho_a}{r_a} C_p^{air} (T_a - T_{vs})
$$ {#eq-qh}

where $\rho_a$ is the air density (kg m^-3^), $C_p^{air}$ is the specific heat capacity of air (J kg^-1^ K^-1^), $T_a$ is the air temperature, and $r_a$ is the aerodynamic resistance (s m^-1^) which was approximated from Equation 4 from @Allan1998 as:

$$
r_a = \frac{\text{log}(\frac{z_T - d_0}{z_0})\text{log}(\frac{z_u - d_0}{z_0})}{\kappa^2 u_z}
$$ {#eq-ra}

where $z_T$ is the height of temperature measurement (m), $d_0$ is the displacement height (m) which was approximated as 2/3^rd^ the mean canopy height, $z_0$ is the roughness length (m) which was approximated as 1/10^th^ of the mean canopy height, $z_u$ is the wind speed measurement height (m), $\kappa$ is von Karman's constant, 0.41 (-), and $u_z$ is the wind speed measurement at $z_u$ (m s^-1^). 

$Q_l$ was calculated as:

$$
Q_l = \frac{\rho_a}{r_i+r_a} (q_a(T_a) - q_{vs}(T_{vs}))
$$ {#eq-ql}

where $r_i$ is a resistance for transport of moisture from intercepted snow to the canopy air space [Eq. 28 in @Essery2003], $q_a(T_a)$ and $q_{vs}(T_{vs})$ are the specific humidity (-) at the air temperature and canopy snow temperature respectively. If the height of the air temperature measurement differs from the humidity measurement the $z_T$ term in the @eq-ra should be adjusted to use the the humidity measurement height. 

The above sensible and latent heat flux equations assume neutral atmospheric stability conditions, i.e., nearly adiabatic conditions (no heat exchange) which may be appropriate for application with snow which is intercepted in the roughness elements where stability corrections may not be required [@Allan1998]. This is also supported by the uncertainty of stability correction in forest canopies [@Conway2018] and mountain environments [@Helgason2012a]. Solving @eq-eb requires an iterative solution to determine $\Delta T_{vs}$ and the remaining terms which are also a function of $T_{vs}$. 

# Modelled Canopy Snow Energy and Mass Balance

The energy and mass balance of canopy snow was simulated using the Cold Regions Hydrological Model (CRHM) to evaluate the new canopy snow ablation routine. A full description of the CRHM model is described in @Pomeroy2007 and the up to date source code is available at https://github.com/srlabUsask/crhmcode. In addition to the updated parameterisations presented in this study, parameterisations from previous studies that simulate canopy snow unloading, melt, and sublimation were also implemented and compared against the updated routine within CRHM. Canopy snow sublimation simulations also provided the rate of sublimation needed in @eq-unld-melt-mass-bal.

In addition to the updated parameterisations presented in this study, three other canopy snow ablation routines were implemented in CRHM following previous studies by @Ellis2010 and @Floyd2012 (E10), @Roesch2001 (R01), and @Andreadis2009 who built on observations by @Storck2002 (SA09). The E10 parameterisation set was previously integrated into CRHM as a module and is the one typically used to simulated snow accumulation in forests in CRHM and was run as is. The E10 model includes canopy snow sublimation as described in @Pomeroy1998b, canopy snow unloading based on a maximum canopy snow load and exponential decay over time from @Hedstrom1998 with modifications described in @Floyd2012 to handle canopy snow melt and drip processes using an ice-bulb temperature threshold. The R01 model represents canopy snow unloading and melt/drip using linear functions of wind speed and air temperature. The SA09 parameterisation unloads snow as a ratio of the canopy snowmelt rate, following observations by @Storck2002 and does not include wind induced unloading. The snowmelt rate from @eq-eb was used to calculate the unloading rate for the @Andreadis2009 unloading, and thus differs from the energy balance routine described in their study. The retension of canopy snow meltwater differs between the four parameterisation sets. For @Ellis2010 parameterisation liquid meltwater is not retained in the canopy and immediately drips, before it can evaporate. The @Roesch2001 air temperature function includes mass unloading of snow and drip and thus handles the removal of meltwater from the canopy. Canopy liquid water storage capacity ($L_{max}^{liq}$, mm m^-2^) from @Andreadis2009 and the updated routine from this study was calculated as:

$$
L_{max}^{liq} = Lh + nLAI
$$

where $n$ is the fraction of the intercepted snow mass that can hold meltwater and $n$ is a storage constant of the vegetation elements. @Andreadis2009 estimate $h$ equal to 3.5% and $n = e^-4$, and the two-sided LAI was used. In this study we set $h$ equal to 1% and $n = C_c\cdot 0.2$ and the one sided LAI was used, as in @Ellis2010 for rainfall interception. 

# Results

## Canopy Snow Unloading Relationships

A multivariate linear model that included canopy snow load, canopy snowmelt, and wind speed produced the highest *R^2^* (*p* < 0.05, *R^2^* = `r lm_multi_reg_tbl$Adj_R2[1] |> round(2)`) among models tested for predicting canopy snow unloading measured by the subcanopy lysimeters (@tbl-q-unld-bins). Shear stress was found to explain less variability compared to wind speed, when combined with canopy snow load and snowmelt (*p* < 0.05, *R^2^* = `r lm_multi_reg_tbl$Adj_R2[4] |> round(2)`). Air temperature and canopy snow sublimation were not significant predictors in any model (*p* > 0.05; @tbl-q-unld-bins). A model including only canopy load, air temperature, and wind speed produced an *R^2^* of `r lm_multi_reg_tbl$Adj_R2[40] |> round(2)`, though only canopy load and wind speed were statistically significant (*p* < 0.05). As shown in @fig-q-unld-all-bins, unloading rates were substantially more variable across the canopy snowmelt and sublimation bins (0–2 mm hr^-1^) compared to the air temperature and wind speed bins (0–0.5 mm hr^-1^). Additional model comparisons with various combinations of independent variables are presented in the supporting information.

The mean unloading rate was observed to increase with increasing canopy load, air temperature, ice-bulb temperature depression, shear stress, and wind speed (@fig-q-unld-all-bins). Despite the insignificant relationships, air temperature and canopy snow sublimation were positively associated with canopy snow unloading, though for sublimation this relationship was limited to sublimation rates between 0 and 0.3 mm hr^-1^ (@fig-q-unld-all-bins). For sublimation rates higher than 0.3 mm hr^-1^, unloading is observed to decline with further increasing sublimation, as more canopy snow is partitioned to the atmosphere. A decline in unloading is observed for wind speed bins above 3 m s^-1^ possibly from some wind transport and entrainment into the atmosphere, and corresponding increased sublimation rates.

### The Influence of Wind on Unloading

Canopy snow unloading measurements from the subcanopy lysimeters, filtered to include intervals without canopy snowmelt, followed a positive linear relationship with shear stress and a positive exponential relationship with wind speed (@fig-q-unld-wind). Based on these observed relationships the following equations were fit and tested against the observed data:

The wind-driven unloading rate, $q_{unld}^{wind}$, was represented as a linear function of shear stress:

$$
q_{unld}^{wind} = L \cdot \tau_{mid} \cdot a
$${#eq-q-unld-tau}

where $\tau_{mid}$ is the shear stress at mid canopy height and $a$ is a fitting constant.

An exponential function of wind speed was defined as:

$$
q_{unld}^{wind} = L \cdot u_{mid} \cdot a \cdot e^{b\cdot u_{mid}}
$${#eq-q-unld-wind}

where $u_{mid}$ is the wind speed at mid canopy height, and $a$ and $b$ are fitting constants.

The shear stress relationship (@eq-q-unld-tau) accounted for slightly more variability in unloading (*p* < 0.05, *R^2^* = `r q_unld_tau_r2`) compared to wind speed (*p* < 0.05, *R^2^* = `r q_unld_wind_r2`) (@tbl-q-unld-wind). The mean bias of the shear stress model of 0.037 mm hr^-1^ is also lower compared to the wind speed model of 0.048 mm hr^-1^, additional model error statistics and fitting coefficients are provided in @tbl-q-unld-wind. Both models exhibited considerable scatter across the different bins, with notable uncertainty within each bin resulting from instrument error and other processes than wind contributing to unloading (@fig-q-unld-wind). The wind-induced unloading rate was observed to be higher for bins with higher canopy snow load across nearly all bins (@fig-q-unld-wind). The *R^2^* of both the shear stress and wind speed relationships is much higher than the amount of variance explained by wind speed when including intervals with melting snow (@tbl-q-unld-bins). The higher *R^2^* of the shear stress model compared to wind speed, coupled with the better physical representation of kinetic energy, provided the reasoning for selecting shear stress as the independent variable to predict wind-induced unloading in the model evaluation.

### The Influence of Melt on Unloading

The ratio of canopy snow unloading (from @eq-unld-melt-mass-bal) to melt (simulated in CRHM using @eq-eb) was observed to increase with canopy snow load (weighed tree) for canopy snow ablation events in which wind-driven unloading and/or sublimation contributed less than 5% to total ablation, (@fig-unld-melt-ratio). This ratio ranged from approximately 0–0.5 (-) for snow loads between 0 and 5 mm, and increased to a maximum of 5 at a canopy snow load of 30 mm (@fig-unld-melt-ratio). This relationship was represented by the following equation:

$$
q_{unld}^{melt} = R \cdot q_{melt}(L)
$${#eq-q-unld-melt}

where $R$ is the ratio of unloading to canopy snowmelt and $q_{melt}$ is the canopy snowmelt rate (mm hr^-1^). @eq-q-unld-melt is similar to Equation 33 in @Andreadis2009; however, instead of assuming a constant value of 0.4 for $R$, it was determined as:

$$
R = m \cdot L + b
$${#eq-fm}

where $m$ and $b$ were determined as `r q_unld_melt_m` and `r q_unld_melt_b`, respectively, using an ordinary least squares regression.

@eq-q-unld-melt resulted in a statistically significant relationship (*p* < 0.05, *R^2^* = `r q_unld_melt_r2`) based on ordinary least squares linear regression (@fig-unld-melt-ratio). Additional observations of canopy snowmelt from the tipping buckets were also used to estimate the canopy snow unloading-to-melt ratio (@fig-unld-melt-ratio); however, the number of usable observations was limited due to freeze-thaw events that affected the instrument functionality. However, the sparse measurements are still useful in providing some indication of the validity of the CRHM canopy snowmelt/drip routine (@fig-cml-tb). The CRHM estimated cumulative drip is higher than the tipping buckets for two out of the three melt events. A difference in the timing and magnitude of the observed and simulated values were expected due to both instrument uncertainties in the tipping buckets (freezing/thawing) and in the canopy snow energy balance simulation.

## Evaluation of canopy snow ablation parameterisations

The updated canopy snow ablation routine (CP25)—which incorporates canopy snowmelt and sublimation based on the energy balance (@eq-eb), wind-driven unloading (@eq-q-unld-tau), and melt-induced unloading (@eq-q-unld-melt)—was evaluated against measurements from a weighed tree during 17 post-snowfall ablation events. These events had air temperatures ranging from -30.5°C to 6.9°C and wind speeds from calm to 5.3 m s^-1^ (@tbl-event-met). The relative contributions of simulated canopy snowmelt (and associated unloading), sublimation, and wind-driven unloading to total ablation were used to classify each events as either melt-dominated, sublimation-dominated, wind-dominated, or mixed-processes (@tbl-event-met). Melt events exhibited >95% of ablation from melt related processes, with the exception of the 2022-04-23 event, where sublimation accounted for 13% of ablation. Events classified as sublimation- or wind-dominated showed negligible melt contributions, typically 0%, with the exception of where melt contributed 5%. Due to the frequent co-occurrence of wind and sublimation, these processes could not be as clearly separated from one another; sublimation contributed up to 40% for the wind-dominant events, and similarly, wind-driven unloading contributed up to 40% for the sublimation-dominated events.

## Event-based Evaluation of Canopy Load and Hourly Total Ablation Models

Simulated canopy snow load using the CP25 model closely follows the observed weighed tree measurements across all 17 ablation events, demonstrating the most consistent agreement among the models tested (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree). In contrast, the other models produced substantial under- or overestimations of canopy snow ablation during several events (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree). When averaged over all events, CP25 resulted in a reduced mean bias of `r new_model_mb_avg` mm hr^-1^ compared to existing models which had a mean biases ranging from `r old_mods_mb_range[1]` to `r old_mods_mb_range[2]` mm hr^-1^ when assessed with hourly weighed tree ablation and averaged across all events (@fig-cpy-load-mb-boxplot). The large declines in canopy snow load for E10 (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree) are due to the maximum canopy snow load used in this model which ranged from 7 to 12 mm depending on the fresh snow density (which is a function of air temperature).

For the melt events, the two energy balance based models (SA09 and CP25) slightly over estimate the rate of canopy snowmelt and unloading, resulting in negative mean biases of `r melt_new_model_mb_avg` mm hr^-1^ and `r melt_a09_mb_avg` mm hr^-1^ for CP25 and SA09 respectively. The slight improvement for CP25 compared to SA09 comes from the better representation of the increase in unloading for higher canopy snow loads as observed for the 2022-06-14 event which had much higher snow load of 30 mm. The air temperature (R01) and ice-bulb temperature (E10) models have much less consistency over these events and resulted in much greater range in mean biases for the temperature based methods (@fig-cpy-load-mb-boxplot) and a mean bias of over `r min(melt_other_mb_avg)`mm hr^-1^. 

The simulated canopy liquid water capacities of the CP25 and SA09 models are evident during all melt events where the rate of ablation changes for small canopy snow loads below ~1.5 mm and ~0.3 mm for CP25 and SA09 respectively. For events other than 2022-04-23, the observed decline in the total ablation rate tends to initiate at canopy loads around 2 to 3 mm—higher than those predicted by CP25 and SA09. This discrepancy may result not only from differences in liquid water storage capacity but also from the presence of residual ice within the canopy, which likely sublimates and/or melts more slowly than snow. However, both the CP25 and SA09 models treat it as snow.

![Time series of canopy snow load for individual events measured by the weighed tree (Observed) and simulated using the various models.](figs/crhm-analysis/model-comparison/obs_mod_canopy_snow_load_store_liquid_new_evap6.png){#fig-obs-mod-w-tree width=85%}

For the sublimation events, all models performed well with mean biases ranging from `r subl_all_mb[1]` to `r subl_all_mb[2]` mm hr^-1^, with a slight improvement in the the mean bias of the updated routine of `r subl_new_model_mb_avg` mm hr^-1^ (@fig-cpy-load-mb-boxplot). An over estimation of canopy snowmelt by the ice-bulb temperature based E10 model causes the steep initial decline in canopy snow load for event 2022-03-02 which is not registered by the weighed tree or other models. However, the overestimation of ablation for this event by E10 is balanced out by underestimates for other events which had wind-driven unloading as this process is not included in this model. For events 2022-03-02 and 2023-03-14 the R01 model overestimates canopy snow ablation due to an over estimation of wind-driven unloading. The energy balance based routines are better able to represent the reduction in sublimation during cool clear nights, resulting from longwave radiation losses, and can be seen during some of the sublimation event nighttime periods, especially for the SA09 model which does not include wind-driven unloading (see 2022-03-24 and 2023-03-14 in @fig-obs-mod-w-tree). The E10 and R01 models estimate canopy snow sublimation using the @Pomeroy1998b analytical model, which assumes that the canopy snow surface temperature remains in thermoequilibrium with the air temperature (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree). For the 2022-03-24 event, the CP25 and SA09 models initially underestimate the ablation rate which coincides with ~90% relative humidity and -5°C air temperatures followed by a steep increase in sublimation as temperatures warm above 0°C and relative humidity drops below 30%. Uncertainty in the air temperature, humidity, and radiation measurements used to drive the energy balance based models in addition to simplifications in the energy balance are interpreted to explain some of the simulation errors.

The wind-driven unloading events show the importance of representing this process, with models that simulate wind-induced unloading having lower mean bias of `r wind_roesch_mb_avg` mm hr^-1^ for R01 and `r wind_new_model_mb_avg` mm hr^-1^ for CP25, compared to the mean bias of over `r wind_nr_mb_avg` mm hr^-1^ for the two simulations that do not directly incorporate wind-induced unloading (@fig-cpy-load-mb-boxplot). Although the E10 model does not include wind-driven unloading, it performs best for the 2023-02-26 event (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree) due to its relatively slow time-based unloading rate compared to CP25 and R01 which over estimate total ablation for this event. The R01 model over estimates the mean event unloading for events 2022-12-01 and 2023-02-26 suggesting the rate of unloading coefficient may be too high for this site. The CP25 model is slightly more stable across the three wind-dominant events, but still underestimates total ablation for event 2023-02-24 which has peak wind speeds of over 5 m s^-1^. Over this event, 1.3 mm of snow entered the adjacent precipitation gauge and is interpreted to be from wind transport, as observed clear skies confirmed no atmospheric precipitation. The amount of snow observed to be unload from the canopy into the subcanopy lysimeters over this event was consistent with simulated unloading in CRHM (@fig-obs-mod-unld). Therefore the ~9 mm of canopy snow ablation not accounted for by CP25 over this event is interpreted to be due to both uncertainties in the wind-driven unloading model (@fig-q-unld-wind) and some entrainment of canopy snow into the atmosphere which was either transported to far away sites and/or sublimated. The wind induced unloading process resulted in the highest overall mean biases compared to the melt and sublimation dominated events. Several processes may contribute to the ease in which snow is unloaded or transported from the canopy due to wind which were not accounted for by any model, including wind transport into the atmosphere, melt/freeze increasing cohesion, liquid water content in canopy snow, decreased cohesion of fresh snow, increased cohesion of older snow due to equitemperature metamorphasism. These factors contribute to the relatively mixed performance of the wind-driven unloading parameterisation that was developed and tested at this site.

For events where wind-driven unloading and sublimation both contribute significantly (i.e., 2022-03-09, 2022-03-02, 2023-03-14, and 2023-02-26, each with more than 0.4 contribution from both processes), the updated routine shows the highest consistency with observations (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree). In contrast, the mixed events on 2022-03-29 and 2022-04-21, which involved more than 0.45 contribution from both melt and sublimation, were best represented by the E10 model (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree).

## Canopy Snow Partitioning

When considering the melt-dominated events, all four parameterisations were relatively consistent in partitioning snow to the ground (drip and unloading) versus the relatively minor amount returned to the atmosphere via sublimation and evaporation (of melted canopy snow) (@fig-partitioning). For the sublimation-dominated events, the two parameterisations that include wind-driven unloading (R01 and CP25) had differing fractions of snow unloading to the ground with a higher fraction for R01 due to the higher wind-driven unloading rate compared to CP25. However, SA09 partitioned all snow back to the atmosphere via sublimation despite the moderate wind speeds observed over the sublimation events. The E10 parameterisation resulted in a greater fraction of snow reaching the ground compared to CP25 for 4 out of 5 of the sublimation events, due to the temporal unloading parameterisation in E10. For the wind events, R01 unloaded the highest fraction of snow to the ground over all three events compared to the other models. The SA09 parameterisation, similar to the sublimation events, returned all intercepted snow back to the atmosphere due to the absence of a wind-driven unloading parameterisation. Although CP25 and E10 include differing unloading processes, when averaged over all events the have a similar fraction of snow reaching the ground (70%) versus the atmosphere (30%) (@tbl-frac-atm-ground). SA09 has the largest discrepancy which returned 40% of intercepted snow back to the atmosphere and the R01 with the least amount of snow reaching the atmosphere with 24%.

# Discussion

## Processes Driving Canopy Snow Unloading

The results presented in @tbl-q-unld-bins provide support for the hypotheses that canopy snowmelt and wind-driven unloading—which are both also moderated by canopy load—are the primary processes driving canopy snow unloading. However, snowmelt- and wind-driven unloading are not typically simulated together in any model [@Ellis2010; @Lumbrazo2022; @Clark2015b; @Verseghy2017]. The results presented here also suggest parameterisations to represent unloading due to wind and melt that differ slightly from existing models. Measurements from the weighed tree lysimeter and simulated canopy snowmelt suggest the ratio of unloading to melt increases with increasing canopy snow load (@fig-unld-melt-ratio). This differs from @Storck2002 who originally found the ratio of canopy snow unloading to melt to be constant at 0.4, based on weighed tree and subcanopy lysimetry measurements. The measurement difficulties noted by @Storck2002 limited their estimate of this ratio to a single mid-December event and thus could not observe any association with canopy snow load. Similar instrument difficulties limited our tipping bucket measurements of subcanopy snowmelt drainage to three events, but still showed an increasing trend in the unloading to melt ratio with snow load also confirming this hypothesis. Although branch bending has been shown to be associated with air temperature [@Schmidt1991; @Schmidt1990], the increase in unloading with air temperature was mainly found to occurring around the melting point in @fig-q-unld-all-bins and thus this process did not need to be represented separately in our dataset. The improved representation of the melt events is also attributed to a new canopy snow energy balance described in @eq-eb. This allows rate of canopy snowmelt to better reflect the available energy and also @eq-q-unld-melt helps represent the associated increase in canopy snow unloading with snowmelt (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree). 

Observations of canopy snow unloading from the subcanopy lysimeters and total ablation from the weighed tree lysimeter confirmed that wind-driven unloading is an important process to represent. Unloading resulting from wind has previously been hypothesized to be a linear function of wind speed and canopy load [@Roesch2001; @Bartlett2015; @Katsushima2023]. Our results differ from previous studies in that the relationship of canopy snow unloading was found to increase exponentially with wind speed, however, unloading was found to increase linearly with shear stress (@tbl-q-unld-wind). The higher *R^2^* found for shear stress compared to wind speed for predicting unloading when excluding melt events (@tbl-q-unld-wind) is inferred to be the better relation of shear stress with the kinetic energy transfer from wind to snow, wind transport, and movement of the canopy. Additional factors that may influence wind-driven unloading that are not considered in the new parameterisation (@eq-q-unld-wind) include increased liquid water content at warmer temperatures increasing cohesion and adhesion to the canopy which may provide some resistance to wind induced unloading. However, a statistically significant negative influence of air temperature on wind speed was not found, likely due to the strong positive association of air temperature and melt on unloading. @eq-q-unld-wind also does not directly include wind transport or erosion of snow into the atmosphere 

The density of snow intercepted in the canopy is expected to influence both wind-driven and melt-induced unloading processes, yet this factor is not explicitly represented in current parameterisations. Fresh, low-density snow typically exhibits lower cohesion and adhesion compared to older snow, which may have undergone freeze-thaw cycles or equitemperature metamorphaisism—processes that increase snow density and mechanical resistance to unloading. While vapour deposition and rime-ice accumulation is simulated in some models [e.g., @Clark2015b; @Ellis2010] via the latent head flux parameterisation, it is usually treated as additions to the canopy snow reservoir. However, in humid or maritime regions rime can form dense, ice-like structures [e.g., @Berndt1969] with high resistance to unloading by either melt or wind [@Lumbrazo2022]. Although sufficient rime ice accumulation to affect the unloading process was not observed during the present study, it remains a key research gap for some regions. 

Some evidence of increased unloading associated with sublimation was observed (@fig-q-unld-all-bins), consistent with some previous findings (@MacDonald2010) theorized to be due to the reduction in structural integrity and bond weakening of the canopy snow clumps as snow particles are removed through sublimation. However, the relationship in @fig-q-unld-all-bins was weak and statistically insignificant and limited to relatively low sublimation rates. It is possible that this apparent associated arises from the concurrent increase in canopy energy inputs that promote both sublimation and other unloading mechanisms such as melt and wind-driven removal.

## Performance Comparison of Unloading Parameterisations

The improved performance of the new CP25 parameterisation across a range of meteorological conditions—including warm and humid, cold and dry, windy, and mixed regimes—demonstrates the robustness of physically based representations of the energy balance and snow unloading processes. In contrast, previously developed parameterisations relied on simplified approaches to represent melt and drip processes such as time-dependent exponential decay and ice-bulb temperature thresholds [@Ellis2010], empirical functions of air temperature and wind speed [@Roesch2001], or a function of melt alone [@Storck2002; @Andreadis2009], which limited their applicability across varying environmental conditions. By explicitly representing sublimation as well as wind-driven and melt-induced unloading, CP25 achieved more consistent performance across a diverse range in canopy snow ablation events reducing event-to-event variability in bias. 

While the SA09 parameterisation—originally developed in a relatively warm maritime climate with limited wind influence [@Storck2002]—performed comparably to CP25 during melt-dominated events, its lack of wind-induced unloading led to poor performance for wind- and sublimation-dominated events. This process omission caused SA09 to overestimate sublimation, returning a greater fraction of intercepted snow back to the atmosphere. Moreover, for one melt event with large canopy load the SA09 method had reduced performance and for the tail end of the melt events SA09 had reduced performance and is attributed to differences in the liquid water holding capacity of the two parameterisations. 

The temperature-based E10 and R01 parameterisations showed inconsistent performance, particularly during melt events, where they generally underestimated ablation due to their reliance on air temperature or ice-bulb temperature as proxies for energy input into the canopy. Although E10 lacked a representation of wind-driven unloading, its exponential decay parameterisation partially compensated for this process, but still underestimated unloading overall. Conversely, R01 systematically overestimated wind-driven unloading, resulting in an overestimate of total ablation during both wind- and sublimation-dominated events (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree). 

As a result of the missing processes in the E10, SA09, and R01 parameterisations they did not produce consistent results across the differing canopy snow ablation event types. While the CP25 parameterisation shows improved accuracy across the melt-, sublimation-, and wind-dominated events there is still some uncertainty in the magnitude of snow that reaches the ground versus the atmosphere. For the melt events while the total ablation is closely matched for CP25, the amount of canopy snow meltwater that was evaporated was not measured in this study. The comparison of CP25 to the amount of canopy snow meltwater drainage into the tipping buckets provides the best validation of this partitioning and suggests there may be a slight over estimating in the amount of liquid water reaching the ground and thus an underestimating in canopy snow meltwater evaporation. This evidence is corroborated by the over estimation of total ablation at the tail end of the melt events for CP25 and suggests the canopy may be able to hold more liquid melt water and thus subject it to evaporation. Similarly, while accurate performance of CP25 was achieved for sublimation events with low wind speed—and thus little wind-driven unloading—events with higher winds had uncertainty in the amount of snow unloaded versus sublimated.

## Canopy Snow Partitioning

Accurately partitioning precipitation into throughfall and atmospheric losses is a crucial component of both hydrological and climate models. Despite this importance, there is large variability in the amount of snow partitioned to the atmosphere and to the ground depending on the canopy snow ablation routine that is selected (@fig-partitioning). For example, by not including wind-driven unloading as in the SA09 parameterisation, 10% less snow reached the ground over all 17 of the selected events (only 3 were considered wind-dominated) due to the longer duration snow was intercepted in the canopy compared to the CP25 and E10 parameterisations. Although E10 and CP25 include differing process representations a similar fraction of snow was simulated to reach the ground vs returned to the atmosphere. The agreement between CP25 and E10 is encouraging, since the E10 has been tested on subcanopy snow accumulation to perform well across the globe, but may have been getting the right answer for the wrong reasons due to the large deviation in process representation between CP25 and E10. For regions which intercept a larger amount of snow, where the E10 maximum canopy snow load would over estimate the amount of unloading, a greater deviation between the E10 and CP25 parameterisation is expected.   

## Energy Balance Based Sublimation Parameterisation 

The energy balance sublimation routine in CP25—based on @Essery2003—had overall performance similar to R01 and E10, both of which incorporate the analytical sublimation parameterisation @Pomeroy1998b (@fig-cpy-load-mb-boxplot). However, an advantage of the energy balance approach is its ability to simulate surface cooling of the canopy snow during clear nights when longwave radiative losses exceed incoming longwave radiation from the atmosphere. This effect—driven by low atmospheric emissivity under cloud-free conditions—led to improved representation of sublimation events during night time periods (e.g., the event on 2022-03-24 in @fig-obs-mod-w-tree). In contrast, R01 and E10 tended to slightly overestimate sublimation under similar conditions, as they increased sublimation in response to low humidity but did not account for reductions in surface temperature.

## Limitations of Wind Transport Representation 

The lack of wind-transport in the CP25 parameterisation explains the underestimation of wind-driven ablation for one of the wind-dominated ablation events (2023-02-24, @fig-obs-mod-w-tree). However, the wind transport of canopy snow over this event was observed to be relatively small at 1.3 mm of a total of 20 mm of canopy snow that was ablated over the event and the remaining underestimate in ablation is interpreted to originate from uncertainties in the sublimation and wind-driven unloading parameterisations. Given the relatively low contribution of wind transport for event 2023-02-24 which had the highest mean and peak wind speed (@tbl-event-met) not including this process in our analysis likely did not have a major impact on the results for this study site. The over estimation of wind-driven unloading from the @Roesch2001 based parameterisation compared to the wind-driven unloading function developed in this study may be attributed to the use of above canopy albedo as a proxy of canopy snow unloading, while the subcanopy lysimeter based measurements used in this study observed a more direct measurement of the canopy snow unloading rate. However, the wind unloading coefficients are likely site specific [@Lumbrazo2022] and related to forest structure and snow conditions which will require additional field-based investigations on canopy snow unloading to test their transferability. 

## Future Directions 

Process-based routines like CP25 are especially important when considering future climate change, where temperature dependent parameters like those used in the E10 and R01 parameterisations may shift due to warming. Moreover, the improved representation of melt events by CP25 also suggests this parameterisation is better suited for warmer climates compared to the temperature based routines (E10 and R01).

The liquid water holding capacity of canopy snow and vegetation is another area of uncertainty which has direct implications for the amount of evaporation of liquid water intercepted in the canopy. The mixed performance of the updated parameterisations presented in this study for the tail end of melt events suggests further research on this topic is needed which could benefit from additional careful measurements of canopy snow load and associated ablation. However, the magnitude of interception losses due to evaporation over the melt events, where sublimation was predicted to be minimal, was observed to be small and may not be a large sensitivity (@fig-partitioning).

Wind-driven unloading introduced the greatest uncertainty among the simulated processes and while the revised parameterisation produced the best results at this sit further investigation is warranted across diverse sites. Given that wind-driven unloading and sublimation are competitive canopy snow ablation processes, they both have a large sensitivity on the amount of intercepted snow that is partitioned to the ground versus the atmosphere. 

Measuring canopy snow sublimation, and differentiating canopy snow unloading from liquid drainage from the canopy remain difficult and are inhibiting the development of more robust parameterisations. 

While there are advantages of treating initial interception and ablation processes separately [@Cebulski2025; @Cebulski2025a], these parameterisations still need to be combined and tested together.

Improved simulation of canopy snow ablation may be achieved by incorporating the updated unloading processes from this study which could have important implications for accurately partitioning precipitation to the ground versus the atmosphere and canopy albedo in hydrological and climate models. However, additional testing at other sites with diverse climate and forest types and scales is needed.
 
# Conclusions

-   Canopy snow load, wind speed, and melt rate were statistically significant predictors of snow unloading, collectively explaining 80% of its variability.
-   New parameterisations for wind-driven and melt-induced unloading are introduced, with key differences from previously established approaches.
-   Shear stress, was found to be a stronger predictor of canopy snow unload (*R^2^* = 0.66) compared to wind speed (*R^2^* = 0.52) for non-melt periods. 
-   Snow unloading during melt events was linked to the canopy melt rate, and while consistent with existing ratio-based approaches, a new observation was that this ratio increased with greater canopy snow load. 
-   Observed drip from canopy snowmelt during three warm events generally matched simulated meltwater drainage, though some measurement uncertainty remains.
-   The updated canopy snow ablation scheme—combining wind- and melt-induced unloading with an energy balance-based melt and sublimation routine—produced the most consistent results across varied meteorological conditions. However, wind-dominated events still showed the largest uncertainties.
-   Partitioning of snowfall between ground and atmosphere varied most among parameterisations for wind- and sublimation-dominated events, while melt-driven events showed greater consistency across models.
