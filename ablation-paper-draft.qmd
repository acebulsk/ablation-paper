<!-- **Abstract:** Existing canopy snow ablation parameterisations have been shown to have uncertain transferability across differing climate and forest types. Moreover, many of the theories underlying the existing parameterisations have not been tested extensively across climate and forest types. Here, novel snow interception process understanding, developed from fine-scale and high-frequency observations collected from needleleaf forests in the Canadian Rockies, is used to decouple the processes that initially load snow in the canopy from those that ablate it. A revised snow interception parameterisation that calculates throughfall as a function of forest structure, is presented with modified canopy snow ablation parameterisations, and implemented in the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling platform to simulate canopy snow load and subcanopy snowpack dynamics. To assess the effectiveness of these new parameterisations, simulations using both new and traditional routines were evaluated against observations of subcanopy snow water equivalent and canopy snow load at sites not used in model development, including the continental climate Marmot Creek, Alberta; subarctic climate Wolf Creek, Yukon Territory; and coastal climate Russell Creek, British Columbia (all in  Canada). Preliminary results show that the revised interception parameterisation improves predictability, increasing the R2 compared to measurements from 0.4 with existing methods to 0.7 with the revised routine. This improved process understanding of snow interception and canopy snow ablation processes may have broad applicability and reliability, improving water resource assessment of forested, snow-dominated basins. -->

<!-- Thesis outline: -->

<!--  Previous studies have developed parameterisations to represent ablation processes including unloading, melt, drip and sublimation of snow intercepted in the canopy. However, these parameterisations have been shown to have uncertain transferability to new environments and have not yet been tested in discontinuous forest canopies. This study presents new in-situ measurements of canopy snow ablation processes and contrasts these observations with existing theories and models. Analysis of the canopy snow mass balance showed that unloading, drip and melt contributed to 60% of canopy snow ablation on average over two years with the remainder being attributed to canopy snow sublimation. The probability of unloading, drip and melt was observed to increase with air temperature and wind speed. However, the probability of wind induced unloading was observed to decrease at warmer air temperatures. The probability of unloading due to warming was also observed to decline when wind speeds were above 1 m s-1. The increase in cohesion and adhesion of snow in the canopy at warmer temperatures and cooling due to wind-induced evaporation may contribute to the interaction multivariate interaction between air temperature, wind speed and canopy snow unloading. Exponential relationships were observed between both air temperature and wind speed with unloading and drip, which were also dependent on the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy. In comparison to existing models, this discontinuous forest exhibited unloading and drip due to warming at lower air temperatures. Conversely, wind-induced unloading occurred at higher wind speeds than predicted by current models. -->

# Introduction

The seasonal snowpack is an essential component of water resources in cold-regions across the globe [@Immerzeel2020; @Viviroli2020], yet are under threat by rapid climate and land cover change [@Lopez-Moreno2014; @Szczypta2015; @Fang2023; @Aubry-Wake2023]. Forest canopies cover over half of the snow covered zone in the northern Hemisphere [@Kim2017] and therefore, understanding these systems are crucial for making informed ecological, land management, and water resource decisions. Vegetation cover can significantly alter the quantity by up to 45% [@Essery2003; @Sanmiguel-Vallelado2020] and timing [@Ellis2010; @Safa2021] of snow that reaches the ground, through initial interception and subsequent ablation via sublimation, melt, and unloading. Needleleaf canopies are particularly effective at intercepting snowfall [@Hedstrom1998; @Storck2002; @Cebulski2025a], where intercepted snow is subject to increased energy fluxes relative to the the subcanopy snowpack leading to increased rates of melt and/or sublimation [@Pomeroy1998b; @Parviainen2000; @Storck2002; @Roesch2001]. The partitioning of snow to the atmosphere via sublimation [@Pomeroy1998b; @Parviainen2000] or to the ground through unloading and meltwater drip [@Storck2002; @Roesch2001; @Lumbrazo2022] is highly sensitive to meteorological conditions and forest structure contributing to substantial variability across regions and snowfall events. Coastal humid environments typically exhibit reduced sublimation losses [@Storck2002], while enhanced canopy energy exchange can modify both the timing and physical state of snow reaching the forest floor. Conversely, continental climates with colder and drier conditions may experience substantial canopy sublimation losses [@Pomeroy1998b; @Parviainen2000; @Essery2003], though these can be mitigated by unloading rates [@Roesch2001; @Lundquist2021; @Lumbrazo2022]. Consequently, reliable models of snow accumulation and resulting streamflow in forested basins rely on a comprehensive understanding of interception processes [@Essery2003; @Pomeroy2022; @Clark2015b; @Verseghy2017].

Recent work has highlighted the importance of distinguishing between the initial snow interception and subsequent ablation processes [@Cebulski2025]. This separation allows for individual parameterizations for distinct processes, improving both process representation and the modular design of contemporary models—thereby supporting broader applicability across diverse environments [@Clark2015b; @Pomeroy2022]. In addition, @Lundquist2021 and @Cebulski2025a demonstrated improved representation of canopy snow processes without a maximum canopy snow load, typically included in the initial accumulation parameterisation. Together these studies [@Cebulski2025; @Cebulski2025a; @Lundquist2021] emphasize the need to revisit canopy snow ablation parameterisations, as existing routines were developed alongside accumulation schemes that already account for part of the ablation process. Moreover, canopy snow unloading parameterisations have demonstrated limited transferability across different climates and forest types [@Lundquist2021; @Lumbrazo2022], and this limitation has attributed as a key area of uncertainty in forest snowpack simulations in hydrological model intercomparisons [@Rutter2009; @Krinner2018]. 

Ablation of snow intercepted in the canopy as mass clumps of snow towards the ground, typically referred to as unloading, has been shown to be associated with air temperature [@Roesch2001; @Katsushima2023], ice-bulb temperature—which better represents the cooling effect of sublimation compared to air temperature—[@Ellis2010; @Floyd2012], canopy snowmelt rate [@Storck2002], and wind speed as shown in @fig-unl-ex-wind for @Roesch2001 [@Roesch2001; @Bartlett2015; @Katsushima2023], all of which are also a function of the canopy snow load. Additional detail on the individual parameterisations and associated uncertainties related to measurement difficulties and isolating individual process is discussed in @Cebulski2025. 

Melt of snow intercepted in the canopy is typically represented by either an energy balance approach [e.g., @Clark2015b; @Andreadis2009], as a function of air temperature [@Roesch2001], or a function of ice-bulb temperature [@Ellis2010; @Floyd2012] (@fig-unl-ex-temp). Sublimation is represented using an energy balance approach [e.g., @Essery2003; @Verseghy2017] or an analytical parameterisation [@Ellis2010] following @Pomeroy1998b. Both the @Essery2003 and @Pomeroy1998b parameterisation include an aerodynamic resistance term to decrease the latent heat flux from snow intercepted in the canopy as the canopy fills up with snow and its surface area decreases. However, the resistance term is based on earlier estimates of the maximum canopy snow load which has shown to be an underestimate in many other areas [@Storck2002; @Lundquist2021; @Cebulski2025a] and should be reconsidered using a larger maximum load. The merits of including more physically based energy balance methods compared to more empirically based functions for calculating snowmelt and sublimation have not been directly assessed using an event based process investigation. 

Quantifying individual canopy snow ablation processes including unloading, melt, and sublimation remains challenging, even with sophisticated lysimetry [@Storck2002] and eddy-covariance systems [@Helgason2012b; @Conway2018; @Harvey2025]. Consequently, some studies have developed canopy snow ablation parameterizations using methods that do not distinguish individual processes such as above canopy albedo [@Roesch2001; @Bartlett2015]. While these approaches offer useful indicators of overall model performance, they provide limited insight into the accuracy of individual process representations. Lysimeter-based measurements offer more direct process-level observations but are limited by freeze–thaw cycles and concurrent processes [@Storck2002; @Floyd2012]. A hybrid diagnostic approach that combines individual process measurements with simulations, as well as, full-output metrics such as canopy snow load from a weighed tree has yet to be applied but is explored in this study. 

The objective of this study is to determine if the theoretical underpinnings and assumptions behind existing canopy snow ablation parameterisations are supported by in-situ observations collected from a subalpine forest in the Canadian Rockies. This study specifically looks at canopy snow ablation after snowfall, initial interception has been discussed in @Cebulski2025.

Research Questions:

1. How does air temperature, wind, canopy snow sublimation, and snowmelt influence the rate of canopy snow unloading?

2. To what extent do current theoretical models of canopy snow ablation align with in-situ observations?

3. What modifications of existing models, if any, are necessary to accurately represent ablation of snow intercepted in the canopy and what is the performance of the updated model?

# Study Site and Instrumentation

The observations presented in this study were collected at Fortress Mountain Research Basin (FMRB), AB, -115° W, 51° N, a continental headwater basin in the Canadian Rockies at 2100 m above sea level. Air temperature, humidity, and wind speed were measured at a height of 4.3 m at Forest Tower (FT) Station (@fig-site-map). Shear stress was calculated using the EddyPro software (LI-COR Biosciences) based on high-frequency wind measurements from a CSAT3 three-dimensional sonic anemometer (Campbell Scientific) installed at 3.0 m at FT station. The CSAT3 was frequently covered in snow during the analysis period, and thus to provide a complete record of shear stress, a linear relationship between was established between shear stress derived from the CSAT3 and the square of wind speed measured at 4.3 m at the FT station (*R^2^* = 0.71, *p* < 0.05, see supporting information). This relationship was then used to gap-fill shear stress during periods when the CSAT3 was snow-covered. The precipitation rate was measured by an Alter-shielded OTT Pluvio weighing precipitation gauge installed 2.6 m above ground at Powerline (PWL) Station (@fig-site-map). Incoming and outgoing solar radiation was measured by a Kipp & Zonen CNR4 4-Component Net Radiometer installed 3.27 m above the ground at Fortress Ridge Station 2.0 km to the northwest of FT station (-115.2, 50.8). This windy exposed site was selected to reduce snow accumulation on the radiometer, in addition to the CNR4's built-in heating element. Three subcanopy lysimeters, consisting of a plastic horse-watering trough with an opening of 0.9 m^2^ and depth of 20 cm suspended from a load cell, were installed to measure subcanopy snow accumulation. A weighed tree lysimeter (subalpine fir) suspended from a load cell (Artech S-Type 20210-100) measured the weight of canopy snow load (kg) and was scaled to an areal estimate of snow load (mm) using snow surveys as in @Pomeroy1993a. Additional details on this study site and the meteorological and lysimeter measurements have been described in @Cebulski2025a. Four tipping bucket rain gauges, 3 Texas Electronics TR-525M and 1 Hyquest Solutions TB4MM were installed along a 15 m transect adjacent to the dense canopy subcanopy lysimeter to measure canopy snowmelt drainage. To isolate the subcanopy lysimeter measurements of canopy snow unloading from throughfall, 15-min intervals were selected that met the following criteria: no atmospheric precipitation, and snow was observed to be intercepted in the canopy using the weighed tree and timelapse imagery investigation.

# Methods

## Statistics on Canopy Snow Unloading Relationships

### Combined influence of predictors on unloading 

The influence of air temperature, wind speed, snow load, melt, and sublimation on the unloading process was assessed using a multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. The analyses tested the following hypotheses:

  a. Melt promotes unloading through loss of structural integrity, particle bond weakening, and lubrication.
  b. Sublimation promotes unloading via structural degradation and bond weakening.
  c. Wind promotes unloading through shear stress on snow, wind erosion, and branch movement.
  d. Air temperature promotes unloading by increased elasticity branches and association with melt/sublimation.

Since many of these processes occur simultaneously and could not be isolated experimentally, different combinations of the independent variables were included in the regression to identify which sets of processes significantly influenced unloading. The subcanopy lysimeter unloading measurements had a high relative instrument error due to the relatively small accumulation of unloaded snow over the 15-min intervals. To improve instrument accuracy, while maintain consistency of the unloading measurements with wind speed, the 15-min interval measurements of unloading were aggregated over differing predictor variable bins. Air temperature and wind speed were measured at FT station, canopy snow load from the weighed tree lysimeter (scaled to the canopy of each respective subcanopy lysimeter), and canopy snowmelt and sublimation simulated using the Cold Regions Hydrological Modelling Platform (CRHM). A full description of the CRHM model is described in @Pomeroy2007 and the up to date source code is available at https://github.com/srlabUsask/crhmcode. Sublimation was simulated using @eq-ql following @Essery2003 and snowmelt calculated using available energy from @eq-eb and were both implemented as a new module in CRHM. Independent variable bins that had less than 0.1 mm of accumulated snow were removed, resulting in a mean instrument error of +/- 2% for the remaining bins. The individual processes found to be significant predictors of unloading in the multivariate regression (i.e., shear stress and canopy snow melt) were then isolated to parameterise a model of their effects.

### Wind induced unloading

The influence of wind, shear stress and canopy snow load on unloading was assessed during intervals without canopy snowmelt. These periods were defined using simulated canopy snowmelt in CRHM and by visual analysis of time-lapse imagery. By excluding periods influenced by melt, the snow captured by the lysimeters is attributed primarily to wind-driven unloading. Although unloading resulting from snow metamorphism or thermally induced branch bending may also contribute, the observed unloading is interpreted to be predominantly wind-induced over these intervals. The relationship between wind speed, shear stress, canopy snow load, and unloading was analyzed using linear and non-linear least squares regression, with shear stress modelled linearly and wind speed modelled exponentially. The linear relationship between shear stress, canopy load, and unloading did not include an intercept term and was thus the coefficient of determination (*R^2^*) was adjusted following [@Kozak1995].

### Canopy snowmelt induced unloading 

A mass balance approach was incorporated to determine the unloading rate resulting from canopy snowmelt ($q_{unld}^{melt}$, mm s^-1^). The influence of canopy snowmelt on $q_{unld}^{melt}$ was then assessed by fitting a linear model using an ordinary least squares regression. Since direct measurements of canopy snow unloading are challenging to obtain independently from canopy snowmelt drainage [@Storck2002], the following mass balance was incorporated to determine $q_{unld}^{melt}$ as a residual:

$$
\frac{dL}{dt} = 
[q_{sf} - q_{tf} + q_{ros}] - [q_{unld}^{melt} + q_{unld}^{wind}] - q_{drip} - q_{wind}^{veg} - q_{sub}^{veg}
$$ {#eq-canopy-mass-bal}

where $\frac{dL}{dt}$ is the change in canopy snow load over time, (mm s^-1^), $q_{sf}$ is the snowfall rate (mm s^-1^), $q_{tf}$ (mm s^-1^) is the throughfall rate (mm s^-1^), $q_{ros}$ (mm s^-1^) is the rate of rainfall falling on snow intercepted in the canopy, $q_{unld}^{melt}$ is the canopy snow unloading rate due to melt (mm s^-1^), $q_{unld}^{wind}$ is the canopy snow unloading rate due to wind (mm s^-1^), $q_{drip}$ is the canopy snow drip rate resulting from canopy snowmelt (mm s^-1^), $q_{wind}^{veg}$ is the wind transport rate in or out of the control volume (mm s^-1^), and $q_{sub}^{veg}$ is the intercepted snow sublimation rate (mm s^-1^). Figure 1 in @Cebulski2025 presents a visual representation of this mass balance. 

Then @eq-canopy-mass-bal was rearranged to solve for $q_{unld}^{melt}$ during intervals without $[q_{sf} - q_{tf} + q_{ros}]$ or $q_{wind}^{veg}$ as:

$$
q_{unld}^{melt} = -\frac{dL}{dt} - q_{drip} - q_{unld}^{wind} - q_{sub}^{veg}
$${#eq-unld-melt-mass-bal}

While some components of the canopy snow mass balance can be measured directly with relative ease, such as $\frac{\Delta L}{\Delta t}$ with the weighed tree, sublimation of canopy snow is more difficult to quantify directly especially in forested mountain environments [@Helgason2012b; @Conway2018] and thus $q_{sub}^{veg}$ was simulated in this study in CRHM using @eq-ql as described in @Essery2003. $q_{drip}$ was measured where possible using the tipping buckets, however problems with freezing of liquid water in the devices limited the amount of $q_{drip}$ that could be collected. Thus, $q_{drip}$ was also supplemented with simulated canopy snowmelt ($q_{melt}$) in CRHM as in @eq-eb. Canopy snow ablation periods that were dominated by melt were selected for calculating $q_{unld}^{melt}$ where the contribution of $q_{unld}^{wind}$ and $q_{sub}^{veg}$ to canopy snow ablation was less than 5%. 

# Canopy Snow Energy Balance 

The energy available for melting snow intercepted in the canopy, $Q_{melt}$ (W m^-2^), which is a function of the canopy snow load ($L$) was calculated as:

$$
Q_{melt}(L) = 
Q_{sw} +
Q_{lw} +
Q_{p} + Q_{h} + Q_{l} - [C_p^{ice} L \frac{\Delta T_{vs}}{\Delta t}]
$$ {#eq-eb}

where $Q_{sw}$ and $Q_{lw}$ (W m^-2^) are the net shortwave and longwave radiation heat fluxes to the canopy snow, $Q_p$ (W m^-2^), is the advective energy rate, and $Q_{l}$ and $Q_{h}$ (W m^-2^), are the turbulent fluxes of latent heat and sensible heat respectively (positive towards canopy snow), $C_p^{ice}$ (J kg^-1^ K^-1^) is the specific heat capacity of ice, and $\frac{\Delta T_{vs}}{\Delta t}$ (K s^-1^) is the change in canopy snow temperature over time. 

$Q_{sw}$ was determined as:

$$
Q_{sw} = \downarrow Q_{sw} \cdot (1 - \alpha_s) \cdot \tau_{50}^{veg}
$$ {#eq-sw}

where $\downarrow Q_{sw}$ is the downwelling shortwave radiation (W m^-2^), $\alpha_s$ is the albedo of snow intercepted in the canopy (-), $\tau_{50}^{veg}$ (-) is the canopy transmittance to $\downarrow Q_{sw}$. $\tau_{50}^{veg}$ was determined using Equation from @Pomeroy2009 with half of the leaf area index (LAI), following studies [@Weiskittel2009; @Kesselring2024], who report that approximately 50% of the total leaf area is concentrated in the upper half of coniferous canopies. This provides an approximation of the mean $Q_{sw}$ to all snow intercepted in the canopy, and is a simplification from using a partial differential equation to determine the radiation incident to individual height layers within the canopy. Upwelling shortwave radiation reflected off of the surface snowpack is considered negligible contribution to the snow intercepted in the canopy as it is primarily blocked by vegetation elements underlying the canopy snow. 

$Q_{lw}$ was approximated as:

$$
Q_{lw} = \downarrow Q_{lw}^{atm} + \uparrow Q_{lw}^{veg} + \uparrow Q_{lw}^{veg2veg} - Q_{lw}^{vs}
$$ {#eq-lw}

where $Q_{lw}^{atm}$ is the downwelling longwave radiation from the atmosphere (W m^-2^), $Q_{lw}^{veg}$ is the longwave radiation upwelling from vegetation elements underlying snow intercepted in the canopy (W m^-2^), $Q_{lw}^{veg2veg}$ is the downwelling longwave radiation emitted from the underside of the vegetation elements reflected by the subcanopy snowpack (W m^-2^), and $Q_{lw}^{vs}$ (W m^-2^) is the outgoing longwave radiation from the top and bottom of the canopy snow layer calculated as:

$$
Q_{lw}^{vs} = 2 \epsilon_{s} \sigma T_{vs}^4
$$ {#eq-lw-vs}

where $\epsilon_s$ is the emissivity (-) of snow taken as 0.99 and $\sigma$ is the Stefan–Boltzmann (5.67e-10 W m^-1^ K^-4^). $Q_{lw}^{atm}$ was approximated in this study as in @Sicart2006 to take into account the influence of atmospheric moisture on emissivity. $Q_{lw}^{veg}$ was calculated with the assumption that canopy elements were in equilibrium with the air temperature plus any change in vegetation temperature from the extinction of $\downarrow Q_{sw}$ in the canopy [@Pomeroy2009, Eq. 4].

$Q_p$ was calculated as:

$$
Q_p = [C_p^{wtr} m_r(T_r - T_{vs}) + C_p^{ice} m_s(T_s - T_{vs})] / \Delta t
$$ {#eq-qp}

where $C_p^{wtr}$ is the specific heat capacity of water (J kg^-1^ K^-1^), $m_r$ is the specific mass of liquid water in precipitation (mm), $T_r$ is the rainfall temperature (K), $m_s$ is the specific mass of snow in precipitation (mm), and $T_s$ is the snowfall temperature (K). 

$Q_h$ was calculated as:

$$
Q_h = \frac{\rho_a}{r_a} C_p^{air} (T_a - T_{vs})
$$ {#eq-qh}

where $\rho_a$ is the air density (kg m^-3^), $C_p^{air}$ is the specific heat capacity of air (J kg^-1^ K^-1^), $T_a$ is the air temperature, and $r_a$ is the aerodynamic resistance (s m^-1^) which was approximated from Equation 4 from @Allan1998 as:

$$
r_a = \frac{\text{log}(\frac{z_T - d_0}{z_0})\text{log}(\frac{z_u - d_0}{z_0})}{\kappa^2 u_z}
$$ {#eq-ra}

where $z_T$ is the height of temperature measurement (m), $d_0$ is the displacement height (m) which was approximated as 2/3^rd^ the mean canopy height, $z_0$ is the roughness length (m) which was approximated as 1/10^th^ of the mean canopy height, $z_u$ is the wind speed measurement height (m), $\kappa$ is von Karman's constant, 0.41 (-), and $u_z$ is the wind speed measurement at $z_u$ (m s^-1^). 

$Q_l$ was calculated as:

$$
Q_l = \frac{\rho_a}{r_i+r_a} (q_a(T_a) - q_{vs}(T_{vs}))
$$ {#eq-ql}

where $r_i$ is a resistance for transport of moisture from intercepted snow to the canopy air space [Eq. 28 in @Essery2003], $q_a(T_a)$ and $q_{vs}(T_{vs})$ are the specific humidity (-) at the air temperature and canopy snow temperature respectively. If the height of the air temperature measurement differs from the humidity measurement the $z_T$ term in the @eq-ra should be adjusted to use the the humidity measurement height. 

The above sensible and latent heat flux equations assume neutral atmospheric stability conditions, i.e., nearly adiabatic conditions (no heat exchange) which may be appropriate for application with snow which is intercepted in the roughness elements where stability corrections may not be required [@Allan1998]. This is also supported by the uncertainty of stability correction in forest canopies [@Conway2018] and mountain environments [@Helgason2012a]. Solving @eq-eb requires an iterative solution to determine $\Delta T_{vs}$ and the remaining terms which are also a function of $T_{vs}$. 

# Modelled Canopy Snow Energy and Mass Balance

Various models of the canopy snow energy and mass balance were implemented in CRHM to facilitate their evaluation. In addition to the updated canopy snow model presented in this study, hereafter referred to as CP25, three other canopy snow models were implemented in CRHM following previous studies by @Ellis2010 and @Floyd2012 (E10), @Roesch2001 (R01), and @Andreadis2009 who built on observations by @Storck2002 (SA09). The E10 model includes canopy snow sublimation as described in @Pomeroy1998b, canopy snow unloading based on a maximum canopy snow load and exponential decay over time from @Hedstrom1998 with modifications described in @Floyd2012 to handle canopy snow melt and drip processes using an ice-bulb temperature threshold. The R01 model represents canopy snow unloading and melt/drip using linear functions of wind speed and air temperature, as well as sublimation using the @Pomeroy1998b parameterisation. The SA09 model unloads snow as a ratio of the canopy snowmelt rate, following observations by @Storck2002 and does not include wind induced unloading. The snowmelt rate from @eq-eb was used to calculate the unloading rate for the @Andreadis2009 unloading, and thus differs from the energy balance routine described in their study. Canopy snow sublimation in SA09 was represented based on the energy balance (@eq-eb). 

The retention of canopy snow meltwater differs between the four canopy snow models. For E10, liquid meltwater is not retained in the canopy and immediately drips before it can evaporate. The @Roesch2001 air temperature function includes mass unloading of snow and drip and thus handles the removal of meltwater from the canopy and also does not evaporate. Canopy liquid water storage capacity ($L_{max}^{liq}$, mm m^-2^) from @Andreadis2009 and the updated routine from this study was calculated as:

$$
L_{max}^{liq} = Lh + nLAI
$$

where $n$ is the fraction of the intercepted snow mass that can hold meltwater and $n$ is a storage constant of the vegetation elements. @Andreadis2009 estimate $h$ equal to 3.5% and $n = e^-4$, and the two-sided LAI was used. In this study $h$  was set equal to 1% and $n = C_c\cdot 0.2$ and the one sided LAI was used, as in @Ellis2010 for rainfall interception. The relative contributions of simulated canopy snowmelt (and associated unloading), sublimation, and wind-driven unloading from the CP25 model to total ablation were used to classify each events as either melt-dominated, sublimation-dominated, wind-dominated, or mixed-processes.

# Results

## Unloading Relationships

Among the models tested, a multivariate linear regression incorporating canopy snow load, canopy snowmelt, and wind speed provided the highest explanatory power for predicting canopy snow unloading measured by subcanopy lysimeters (*R^2^* = `r lm_multi_reg_tbl$Adj_R2[4] |> round(2)`, p < 0.05; @tbl-q-unld-bins). Shear stress was found to explain less variability compared to wind speed, when combined with canopy snow load and snowmelt (*p* < 0.05, *R^2^* = `r lm_multi_reg_tbl$Adj_R2[4] |> round(2)`). Air temperature and canopy snow sublimation were not significant predictors in any model (*p* > 0.05; @tbl-q-unld-bins). A model including only canopy load, air temperature, and wind speed produced an *R^2^* of `r lm_multi_reg_tbl$Adj_R2[40] |> round(2)`, though only canopy load and wind speed were statistically significant (*p* < 0.05). As shown in @fig-q-unld-all-bins, unloading rates were substantially more variable across the canopy snowmelt and sublimation bins (0–2 mm hr^-1^) compared to the air temperature and wind speed bins (0–0.5 mm hr^-1^). Models with additional combinations of independent variables are presented in the supporting information section.

The mean unloading rate was observed to increase with increasing canopy load, air temperature, ice-bulb temperature depression, shear stress, and wind speed (@fig-q-unld-all-bins). Despite the insignificant relationships, air temperature and canopy snow sublimation were positively associated with canopy snow unloading, though for sublimation this relationship was limited to sublimation rates between 0 and 0.3 mm hr^-1^ (@fig-q-unld-all-bins). For sublimation rates higher than 0.3 mm hr^-1^, unloading is observed to decline with further increasing sublimation, as more canopy snow is partitioned to the atmosphere. A decline in unloading is observed for wind speed bins above 3 m s^-1^ possibly from some wind transport and entrainment into the atmosphere, and corresponding increased sublimation rates.

### The Influence of Wind on Unloading

Canopy snow unloading measurements from the subcanopy lysimeters—filtered to include intervals without canopy snowmelt—followed a positive linear relationship with shear stress and a positive exponential relationship with wind speed (@fig-q-unld-wind). Based on these observed relationships the following equations were fit and tested:

The wind-driven unloading rate, $q_{unld}^{wind}$, was represented as a linear function of shear stress:

$$
q_{unld}^{wind} = L \cdot \tau_{mid} \cdot a
$${#eq-q-unld-tau}

where $\tau_{mid}$ is the shear stress at mid canopy height and $a$ is a fitting constant.

An exponential function of wind speed was defined as:

$$
q_{unld}^{wind} = L \cdot u_{mid} \cdot a \cdot e^{b\cdot u_{mid}}
$${#eq-q-unld-wind}

where $u_{mid}$ is the wind speed at mid canopy height, and $a$ and $b$ are fitting constants.

The shear stress relationship (@eq-q-unld-tau) accounted for slightly more variability in unloading (*p* < 0.05, *R^2^* = `r q_unld_tau_r2`) compared to wind speed (*p* < 0.05, *R^2^* = `r q_unld_wind_r2`) (@tbl-q-unld-wind). The mean bias of the shear stress model of 0.037 mm hr^-1^ is also lower compared to the wind speed model of 0.048 mm hr^-1^, additional model error statistics and fitting coefficients are provided in @tbl-q-unld-wind. Both models exhibited considerable scatter across the different bins, with notable uncertainty within each bin resulting from instrument error and processes other than wind contributing to unloading (@fig-q-unld-wind). The wind-induced unloading rate was observed to be higher for bins with greater canopy snow load across nearly all bins (@fig-q-unld-wind). The *R^2^* of both the shear stress and wind speed relationships is much higher than the amount of variance explained by wind speed when including intervals with melting snow (@tbl-q-unld-bins). The higher *R^2^* of the shear stress model compared to wind speed, coupled with the better physical representation of kinetic energy, provided the reasoning for selecting shear stress as the independent variable to predict wind-induced unloading in the model evaluation.

### The Influence of Melt on Unloading

The relationship between canopy snow unloading (calculated using @eq-unld-melt-mass-bal) and melt rates (modeled through CRHM with @eq-eb) demonstrated a positive correlation with accumulated canopy snow load measured on weighed trees (@fig-unld-melt-ratio). This analysis focused on events where wind-induced unloading and sublimation processes accounted for less than 5% of total snow ablation (@tbl-event-met).

When canopy snow loads remained between 0 and 5 mm, the unloading-to-melt ratio varied from approximately 0 to 0.5. As snow loads increased, this ratio exhibited a linear progression, reaching its peak value of 5 when canopy snow load reached 30 mm (@fig-unld-melt-ratio). This observed relationship was mathematically expressed through a linear function:

$$
q_{unld}^{melt} = R \cdot q_{melt}(L)
$${#eq-q-unld-melt}

where $R$ represents the unloading-to-snowmelt ratio and $q_{melt}$ is the canopy snowmelt rate (mm hr^-1^). @eq-q-unld-melt is similar to Equation 33 in @Andreadis2009; however, instead of a constant value of 0.4 for $R$, it was determined as:

$$
R = m \cdot L + b
$${#eq-fm}

where $m$ and $b$ were determined as `r q_unld_melt_m` and `r q_unld_melt_b`, respectively, using an ordinary least squares regression.

@eq-q-unld-melt resulted in a statistically significant relationship (*p* < 0.05, *R^2^* = `r q_unld_melt_r2`) based on ordinary least squares linear regression (@fig-unld-melt-ratio). Additional observations of canopy snowmelt from the tipping buckets were also used to estimate the canopy snow unloading-to-melt ratio (@fig-unld-melt-ratio); however, the number of usable observations was limited to three events due to freeze-thaw events that affected the instrument functionality. However, these measurements are still useful in providing some indication of the validity of the CRHM canopy snowmelt/drip routine (@fig-cml-tb). The CRHM estimated cumulative drip is higher than the tipping buckets for two out of the three melt events. A difference in the timing and magnitude of the observed and simulated values were expected due to both instrument uncertainties in the tipping buckets (freezing/thawing) and in the canopy snow energy balance simulation.

## Event-based Evaluation of Canopy Snow Ablation Models

The updated canopy snow model (CP25)—which incorporates canopy snowmelt and sublimation based on the energy balance (@eq-eb), wind-driven unloading (@eq-q-unld-tau), and melt-induced unloading (@eq-q-unld-melt)—was evaluated against measurements from the weighed tree lysimeter over 17 post-snowfall events. These events had air temperatures ranging from -30.5°C to 6.9°C and wind speeds from calm to 5.3 m s^-1^ (@tbl-event-met). Melt events exhibited >95% of ablation from melt related processes, with the exception of the 2022-04-23 event, where sublimation accounted for 13% of total ablation (@tbl-event-met). Events classified as sublimation- or wind-dominated showed negligible melt contributions, typically 0%, with the exception of where melt contributed 5%. Due to the frequent co-occurrence of wind and sublimation, these processes could not be as clearly separated from one another; sublimation contributed up to 40% for the wind-dominant events, and similarly, wind-driven unloading contributed up to 40% for the sublimation-dominated events.

Simulated canopy snow load using the CP25 model closely matched the weighed tree observations across all 17 events, demonstrating the most consistent agreement among the models evaluated (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree). When averaged by event type, CP25 maintained a consistently low mean bias—in contrast to existing models—which exhibited larger and more variable biases (@fig-cpy-load-mb-boxplot). The large declines in canopy snow load for E10 (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree) are due to the maximum canopy snow load used in this model which ranged from 7 to 12 mm depending on the fresh snow density (a function of air temperature in @Hedstrom1998).

The energy balance-based modeling approaches yielded the most accurate results for melt events, where CP25 achieved a slightly lower absolute mean bias of `r melt_new_model_mb_avg` mm hr^-1^ compared to the `r melt_a09_mb_avg` mm hr^-1^ bias observed with SA09. The slight improvement for CP25 compared to SA09 comes from the better representation of the increase in unloading for higher canopy snow loads as observed for the 2022-06-14 event which had much higher snow load of 30 mm. The air temperature (R01) and ice-bulb temperature (E10) models have much less consistency over these events and resulted in much greater range in mean biases for the temperature based methods (@fig-cpy-load-mb-boxplot) and a mean bias of over `r min(melt_other_mb_avg)`mm hr^-1^. 

The liquid water storage capacities of the CP25 and SA09 models are evident during all melt events where the simulated rate of ablation slows for smaller canopy snow loads below ~1.5 mm and ~0.3 mm for CP25 and SA09 respectively. For events other than 2022-04-23, the observed decline in the total ablation rate tends to initiate at canopy loads around 2 to 3 mm, exceeding the threshold predicted by both models. This discrepancy may result not only from differences in liquid water storage capacity but also from the presence of refrozen meltwater, which likely sublimates and/or melts more slowly than snow. However, both the CP25 and SA09 models treat the refrozen meltwater as new additions to the canopy snow reservoir.

![Time series of canopy snow load for individual events measured by the weighed tree (Observed) and simulated using the various models.](figs/crhm-analysis/model-comparison/obs_mod_canopy_snow_load_store_liquid_new_evap6.png){#fig-obs-mod-w-tree width=100%}

For the sublimation events, all models performed well with mean biases ranging from `r subl_all_mb[1]` to `r subl_all_mb[2]` mm hr^-1^, with a slight improvement in the the mean bias of the updated routine of `r subl_new_model_mb_avg` mm hr^-1^ (@fig-cpy-load-mb-boxplot). An over estimation of canopy snowmelt by the E10 model causes the steep initial decline in canopy snow load for event 2022-03-02 which is not registered by the weighed tree or other models. However, the overestimation of ablation for this event by E10 is balanced out by underestimates for other sublimation events with wind-driven unloading, as this process is not included in this model (@tbl-event-met). For events 2022-03-02 and 2023-03-14 the R01 model overestimates canopy snow ablation due to an over estimation of wind-driven unloading (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree). 

The importance of representing wind-driven unloading is highlighted during wind-dominated events, where models that incorporate this process exhibit reduced mean bias of `r wind_roesch_mb_avg` mm hr^-1^ for R01 and `r wind_new_model_mb_avg` mm hr^-1^ for CP25. In contrast, simulations that do not explicitly account for wind-driven unloading showed a higher mean bias exceeding `r wind_nr_mb_avg` mm hr^-1^ (@fig-cpy-load-mb-boxplot). Although the E10 model does not include wind-driven unloading, it performs best for the 2023-02-26 event (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree) due to its relatively slow time-based unloading rate compared to CP25 and R01 which over estimate total ablation for this event. The R01 model over estimates the mean event unloading for events 2022-12-01 and 2023-02-26 suggesting the rate of unloading coefficient may be too high for this site. The CP25 model is slightly more stable across the three wind-dominant events, but still underestimates total ablation for event 2023-02-24 which has peak wind speeds of over 5 m s^-1^. Over this event, 1.3 mm of snow entered the adjacent precipitation gauge and is interpreted to be from wind transport, as observed clear skies confirmed no atmospheric precipitation. The amount of snow observed to unload from the canopy into the subcanopy lysimeters during this event was consistent with simulated unloading in CRHM (see supporting information) suggesting that the remaining unaccounted-for snow was likely entrained into the atmosphere and sublimated and/or transported to distant sites.

For events where wind-driven unloading and sublimation both contribute significantly—i.e., 2022-03-09, 2022-03-02, 2023-03-14, and 2023-02-26, each with more than 0.4 contribution from both processes—the updated routine shows the highest consistency with observations (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree). In contrast, the mixed events on 2022-03-29 and 2022-04-21, which involved more than 0.45 contribution from both melt and sublimation, were best represented by the E10 model (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree).

## Canopy Snow Partitioning

During melt-dominated events, all four parameterisations showed relatively consistent partitioning of canopy snow, with most being delivered to the ground via unloading and drip, and only a small fraction returned to the atmosphere through sublimation and evaporation of melted snow (@fig-partitioning). For the sublimation-dominated events, the two parameterisations that include wind-driven unloading (R01 and CP25) had differing fractions of snow unloading to the ground with a higher fraction for R01 due to the higher wind-driven unloading rate compared to CP25. However, SA09 partitioned all snow back to the atmosphere via sublimation despite the moderate wind speeds observed over the sublimation events. The E10 parameterisation resulted in a greater fraction of snow reaching the ground compared to CP25 for 4 out of 5 of the sublimation events, due to the temporal unloading parameterisation in E10. For the wind events, R01 unloaded the highest fraction of snow to the ground over all three events compared to the other models. The SA09 parameterisation, similar to the sublimation events, returned all intercepted snow back to the atmosphere due to the absence of a wind-driven unloading parameterisation. Although CP25 and E10 include differing unloading processes, when averaged over all events the have a similar fraction of snow reaching the ground (70%) versus the atmosphere (30%) (@tbl-frac-atm-ground). SA09 has the largest discrepancy which returned 40% of intercepted snow back to the atmosphere and the R01 with the least amount of snow reaching the atmosphere with 24%.

# Discussion

## Processes Governing Canopy Snow Unloading

The canopy snow unloading observations provide support for the hypotheses that snowmelt- and wind-driven unloading—both modulated by canopy load—are the dominant processes governing unloading (@tbl-q-unld-bins). The ratio of unloading to canopy snowmelt was found to increase linearly with increasing canopy snow load (@fig-unld-melt-ratio), and differs from @Storck2002 who originally found the ratio of canopy snow unloading to melt to be constant at 0.4. The measurement difficulties noted by @Storck2002 limited their estimate of this ratio to a single mid-December event, preventing any association with canopy snow load. Similar instrument difficulties limited our tipping bucket measurements of canopy snowmelt drainage to three events (@fig-cml-tb). However, the reasonable correspondence between observed and modeled canopy snow drip across these three events—accounting for measurement uncertainties— also supports this hypothesis (@fig-cml-tb). Previous studies have identified relationships between melt-induced unloading and various meterological parameters, including empirical functions of air temperature [@Roesch2001; @Katsushima2023], ice-bulb temperature [@Ellis2010; @Floyd2012], and solar radiation [@Katsushima2023]. Although branch bending has been shown to be associated with air temperature [@Schmidt1991; @Schmidt1990], our observations indicate that temperature-related unloading increases occur primarily near the freezing point (@fig-q-unld-all-bins), eliminating the need for separate parameterization beyond snowmelt-associated unloading processes.  

Wind driven unloading was found to increase exponentially with wind speed and increase linearly with shear stress (@tbl-q-unld-wind). These results differ from earlier research that has represented this process as a linear function of wind speed and canopy load [@Roesch2001; @Bartlett2015; @Katsushima2023], as shown in @fig-unl-ex-wind. The higher *R^2^* found for shear stress compared to wind speed for predicting unloading—when excluding melt events—is due to the better relation of shear stress with the kinetic energy transfer from wind to snow, wind transport, and movement of the canopy. Still, the wind-driven unloading process resulted in the highest overall mean biases compared to the melt and sublimation dominated events (@fig-cpy-load-mb-boxplot). Additional factors that may influence wind-driven unloading that are not considered in the new parameterisation (@eq-q-unld-wind) include differences in snow density, and increased liquid water content at warmer temperatures increasing cohesion and adhesion to the canopy which may provide some resistance to wind induced unloading. However, a statistically significant negative influence of air temperature on wind speed was not found, likely due to the strong positive association of air temperature and melt on unloading. @eq-q-unld-wind also does not directly include wind transport or erosion of snow into the atmosphere.

The density of snow intercepted in the canopy is expected to influence both wind-driven and melt-induced unloading processes, yet this factor is not explicitly represented in current canopy snow ablation models. Fresh, low-density snow typically exhibits lower cohesion and adhesion compared to older snow, which may have undergone freeze-thaw cycles or equitemperature metamorphaisism, processes that increase snow density and mechanical resistance to unloading. While vapour deposition and rime-ice accumulation is simulated in some models [e.g., @Clark2015b; @Ellis2010] via the latent head flux parameterisation, it is usually treated as additions to the canopy snow reservoir. However, in humid or maritime regions rime can form dense, ice-like structures [e.g., @Berndt1969] with high resistance to unloading by either melt or wind [@Lumbrazo2022]. Although canopy snow density is expected to influence the ablation processes high enough canopy snow densities to influence the ablation process were not observed in this study, yet remains a key research gap for some regions. 

Some evidence of increased unloading associated with sublimation was observed (@fig-q-unld-all-bins), consistent with some previous findings by @MacDonald2010 who theorized this was due to the reduction in structural integrity and bond weakening of the canopy snow clumps as snow particles are removed through sublimation. However, the relationship in @fig-q-unld-all-bins was weak and statistically insignificant and limited to relatively low sublimation rates. It is possible that this apparent association arises from the concurrent increase in canopy energy inputs that promote both sublimation and other unloading mechanisms such as melt and wind-driven removal.

## Performance Comparison of Ablation Models

The improved performance of the new CP25 model across a range of meteorological conditions demonstrates the advantages of incorporating comprehensive snow unloading processes coupled with physically-based representations of the energy balance to simulate ablation (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree). In contrast, existing models were limited by missing processes such as wind-driven unloading (SA09 and E10) or relied on temperature-dependent parameterisations of melt and drip processes (R01 and E10), which restricted their effectiveness. Although the SA09 model—originally developed in a relatively warm maritime climate with limited wind influence [@Storck2002]—performed comparably to CP25 during melt-dominated events, its exclusion of wind-induced unloading led to poor performance for wind- and sublimation-dominated events. This process omission caused SA09 to overestimate sublimation when averaged over all events, returning a much greater fraction of intercepted snow back to the atmosphere (@tbl-frac-atm-ground). Moreover, the constant canopy snow unloading to melt ratio of 0.4 in the SA09 model led to reduced performance for one melt event with canopy snow loads up to 30 mm, where the CP25 model better predicted an increase in the canopy snow unloading to melt ratio. The lower liquid water retention capacity implemented in SA09 also contributed to slight underestimation of canopy loads during the end of most melt events (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree).

Models utilising temperature-based parameterisations (E10 and R01) exhibited inconsistent performance, particularly during melt events where they typically underestimated ablation due to their reliance on air temperature or ice-bulb temperature as proxies for energy input into the canopy. While E10 omitted wind-driven unloading, its exponential time decay parameterisation partially compensated for this process, though it still underestimated overall ablation for the wind-dominated events (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree). The maximum canopy snow load threshold implemented in the E10 model was also observed to be too low compared to the weighed tree measurements, yet this limitation offset its tendency to underestimate unloading processes as was also observed by @Lundquist2021 and @Lumbrazo2022. In contrast, R01 consistently overestimated wind-driven unloading during both wind- and sublimation-dominated events (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree). The over estimation of wind-driven unloading from the R01 model may be attributed to the development of this parameterisation using above canopy albedo as a proxy of canopy snow unloading, which would have included both unloading and sublimation processes in addition to greater measurement uncertainties [@Cebulski2025]. Conversely, the subcanopy lysimeter measurements employed in this study provided more direct quantification of canopy snow unloading rates. Nevertheless, wind unloading parameters are probably location-dependent [@Lumbrazo2022] and influenced by forest composition and snow characteristics, necessitating further field-based research on canopy snow unloading to assess their broader applicability.

The improved representation of the melt events can also be attributed to the newly implemented canopy snow energy balance described in @eq-eb. This approached allowed the rate of canopy snowmelt to more accurately correspond with available energy, while @eq-q-unld-melt effectively captured the corresponding increase in canopy snow unloading associated with snowmelt (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree) compared to previously developed empirical relationships [@Roesch2001; @Floyd2012; @Ellis2010]. The energy balance-based models also have an enhanced capability in simulating canopy snowpack surface temperature and the resulting water vapor gradient between the snow surface and surrounding atmosphere. This contrasts with the E10 and R01 models, which employ the @Pomeroy1998b analytical framework that assumes thermal equilibrium between canopy snow surface temperature and ambient air temperature (@fig-obs-mod-w-tree). The improved characterization of surface-atmosphere vapor pressure gradients likely contributes to the modest performance advantage demonstrated by energy balance models over analytical parameterizations. However, uncertainties in meteorological forcing data (i.e., air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation) used in the energy balance calculations, combined with inherent simplifications in the energy balance formulations, are also contributing factors to the simulation discrepancies exhibited by both CP25 and SA09 models. 

The absence of the wind-transport process in the CP25 model accounts for the underestimation of total ablation during one wind-dominated events (2023-02-24, @fig-obs-mod-w-tree). Wind transport of canopy snow to the nearby Powerline snowfall gauge over this event was observed to be relatively small, 1.3 mm of a total of 20 mm of canopy snow that ablated over the event. Since the snow unloading measured in subcanopy lysimeters corresponded well with CP25 predictions for this event, the approximately 9 mm of unaccounted canopy snow ablation is attributed to both uncertainties within the wind-driven unloading parameterization (@fig-q-unld-wind) and atmospheric entrainment of canopy snow that was either transported to distant locations and/or sublimated. These findings align with observations by @Troendle1983 but contrast with @Hoover1967, who proposed that most wind-transported snow relocates to nearby sites with minimal sublimation effects.

## Canopy Snow Partitioning

Substantial variability exists in the fraction of snow partitioned to the atmosphere versus the ground surface depending on the canopy snow ablation model selected (@fig-partitioning). For example, the exclusion of wind-driven unloading processes in the SA09 model resulted in 10% less snow reaching the ground across all 17 analyzed events (despite only 3 being classified as wind-dominated) due to the extended time snow was intercepted in the canopy and exposed to sublimation in SA09 simulations. Although E10 and CP25 include differing process representations, they predicted comparable fractions of snow reaching the ground versus returning to the atmosphere. The agreement between CP25 and E10 is notable, since the E10 has been tested on subcanopy snow accumulation to perform well across the globe [@Ellis2010; @Gelfan2004; @Pomeroy2022; @Sanmiguel-Vallelado2022]. However, the results shown here reveal that E10's individual process representations had challenges, particularly under warm and windy conditions, potentially explaining the difficulties when applying E10 at new locations where parameterisation errors fail to offset one another [@Lundquist2021; @Lumbrazo2022]. For example, locations which intercept a larger amount of snow, where the E10 maximum canopy snow load would over estimate the amount of unloading, a greater deviation between the E10 and CP25 model is expected.   

## Future Directions 

Physically based approaches such as CP25 are particularly relevant under climate change, where warming may reduce the reliability of temperature-dependent models like E10 and R01. The improved representation of melt events by CP25 and SA09 supports the use of energy balance methods across a range of meteorological conditions, compared to temperature based routines (E10 and R01) which had reduced performance over these events. Among all canopy snow ablation processes, wind-driven unloading and introduced the most uncertainty. Although the revised model performed best at this site, further validation is required across a range of climates and forest structures. Since wind-driven unloading and sublimation are competitive processes, both strongly influence whether snow is returned to the atmosphere or reaches the ground.

Key limitations remain in measuring canopy snow sublimation [@Helgason2012b; @Conway2018; @Harvey2025] and separating snow unloading from meltwater runoff [@Storck2002; @Floyd2012], which are inhibiting the development and validation of canopy snow ablation parameterisations. While separating the initial interception and ablation processes—as proposed in recent work [@Cebulski2025; @Cebulski2025a]—will improve process representation, these routines still need to be evaluated together. Incorporating the updated unloading schemes developed here could improve the representation of canopy snow ablation and, by extension, the partitioning of precipitation and canopy albedo in hydrological and land surface models. Nonetheless, further testing is needed across different sites, climates, forest types, and spatial scales to assess model transferability and performance.

# Conclusions

Canopy snow ablation processes govern the timing and partitioning of snowfall to the ground versus the atmosphere, yet their representation in modeling frameworks remains uncertain due to insufficient process-level validation as a result of sparse observations. This study evaluates existing canopy snow ablation theories using in-situ lysimeter measurements of canopy snow load and subcanopy measurements of unloading and drip. These observations revealed that canopy snow load, wind, and melt were statistically significant predictors of snow unloading, collectively explaining 80% of its variability. In addition to this empirical evidence, physical processes such as structural degradation, particle bond weakening, lubrication of canopy snow during melt, and the shear stress exerted on canopy snow during wind events further support representing these processes. Although some studies use air temperature as an index of unloading resulting from canopy snowmelt and potential branch bending, our results demonstrate improved performance using energy balance methodologies.

Previous studies have demonstrated individual relationships between unloading and wind speed as well as the canopy snow melt rate, but these processes have not been evaluated collectively. Since hydrological models typically do not incorporate these two mechanisms, this study represents the first development and validation of a unified unloading model addressing both processes simultaneously. Novel parameterisations for wind-driven and melt-induced unloading are introduced, with key differences from previously established approaches. Shear stress, was found to be a stronger predictor of canopy snow unloading (*R^2^* = 0.66) compared to wind speed (*R^2^* = 0.52) for non-melt periods. Canopy melt rate exerted the strongest control on snow unloading during melt events, and while consistent one existing model, a new observation was that this ratio increased positively with canopy snow load. Additionally, it was found that an existing approach greatly underestimated the canopy snow storage capacity when compared to observed maximum canopy snow loads from weighed tree measurements. Throughout the two-years of observations presented here, evidence of a maximum canopy snow load was not observed, as the proportional increase in unloading with snow load reduced the canopy load before a maximum was reached. Wind transport events were relatively rare in this subalpine forest, but resulted in a considerable underestimate in the amount of snow returned to the atmosphere for one event.

A revised canopy snow ablation model—integrating wind- and melt-induced unloading with an energy balance-driven melt and sublimation parameterisations—demonstrated consistently improved accuracy across varied meteorological conditions compared to existing methods. Existing models failed to maintain reliable performance across melt-, wind-, and sublimation-dominated events due to absent processes and/or simplification of process representations. The greatest inter-model discrepancies occurred during melt events, where temperature-based parameterisations exhibited substantially higher mean bias relative to the energy balance-based models. 

Wind-dominated events showed the largest uncertainties among all models tested, though performance was improved when using a site-specific shear stress-based parameterisation. Partitioning of snowfall between the ground and atmosphere varied most among parameterisations for wind- and sublimation-dominated events, while melt-driven events showed greater consistency across models. By not including wind-driven unloading, 10% more snowfall was returned to the atmosphere, while one model that overestimated wind-driven unloading directed 5% additional snowfall to the ground surface compared to the updated model. Although improved performance was found for the updated canopy snow ablation model across a wide range of meteorological conditions, additional validation across multiple study locations with variable climate and forest compositions is required to assess model transferability.
