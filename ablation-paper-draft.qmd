## Introduction

![Example of the @Hedstrom1998a (HP98) and @Roesch2001 (RW01) parameterizations for the calculation of unloading and drip rates with increasing air temperature. Wind speed for the RW01 parameterization was set to zero. Note that the HP98 parameterization does not differentiate unloading processes (i.e., metamorphasism, wind-induced, melt) while the RW01 parameterization here calculates unloading and drip of canopy snow due to warming and melt alone and their wind-induced parameterization is shown separately.](figs/examples/unloading_drip_hp98_rw01.png){#fig-unl-ex-temp}

Here the air temperature has been set to a constant of -10°C to set the unloading rate due to warming to zero. The parameterization was run for a range of canopy snow loads (5, 10, 15, and 20 mm).](figs/examples/roesch_unloading.png){#fig-unl-ex-wind}

## Theory

@Roesch2001 proposed a parameterization to calculate the unloading and drip rate of snow intercepted in the canopy. The @Roesch2001 parameterization couples the unloading and drip rates into one equation. However, by isolating the wind-induced unloading function and using the @Storck2002 mass clump unloading parameterization (without drip) an unloading parameterization due to melt and wind can be developed as:

$$
q_{unld} = q_{unld}^{melt} + q_{unld}^{wind}
$$

where $q_{unld}^{wind}$ is the @Roech2001 method to unload snow as a function of wind speed and $q_{unld}^{melt}$ is the @Storck2002 method to unload mass clumps of snow due to melt. See @Cebulski2024b for a detailed description of the @Roesch2001 and @Storck2002 parameterizations.

## Methods

Our lysimeters measure $q_{unld}$ + $q_{drip}$.

$$
  residual = weighed\ tree \ ablation - measured\ unloading
$$

A positive residual here equates to canopy snow that was ablated and was not accounted for by measured unloading (lysimeters) or modelled sublimation. This is inferred here at unloading by drip, wind redistribution, and measurement error. A negative residual means more snow was either measured in the lysimeters and/or modelled sublimation in CRHM than was actually ablated from the weighed tree.

Partition canopy snow ablation in the above graph into unloading, sublimation, and a residual.

To investigate the influence of individual processes on canopy snow unloading, the subcanopy lysimeters were used. The probability of unloading was calculated as:

$$
p_{unld} = \frac{n}{N}
$$

where $p_{unld}$ is the probability of unloading (-), $n$ is the number of unloading events that occurred in a particular met bin, and $N$ is the total number of occurrences of that met bin.

## Results

### Dominant Ablative Processes Observed

@fig-glob-unl-part shows that unloading and drip were the dominant ablative processes observed over two winter seasons for all periods with snow in the canopy and no atmospheric precipitation. Simulated sublimation rates also make up a significant portion of canopy snow ablation and accounted for most of the residual measured ablation. This suggests that for the average conditions in this wind-exposed subalpine forest, wind redistribution of snow intercepted in the canopy is a relatively small component.

@fig-glob-unl-part shows a large increase in the ablation residual with wind speeds above 3.5 m s^-1^ and little association with air temperature. The increase in the residual at high wind speeds is attributed to higher ablation rates measured by the weighed tree due to an associated increase in wind redistribution and sublimation rates. Difficulties in measuring wind redistribution and sublimation rates at this study site limit the ability to partition the residual into these two processes. Modelled sublimation rates shown in @fig-glob-unl-part suggest that for wind speeds above 3.5 m s^-1^ the difference between the residual and modelled sublimation could be attributed to wind redistribution. However, the sublimation parameterization in this simulation has not been tested in wind-exposed forest and may be an underestimate of true sublimation rates at high wind speeds.

### The Influence of Meteorology on Unloading

Snow unloading was investigated during periods of time where snow was in the canopy and no above canopy precipitation was observed. Higher unloading rates were associated with high wind speed or high ice bulb temperature or a combination of both factors. Ice bulb temperature was observed to have a stronger relationship with unloading rates compared to air temperature since the ice bulb temperature is strongly related to sublimation and snowmelt rates which both influence the cohesion and adhesion of snow clumps in the canopy. There was also a negative association of ice-bulb temperature on wind speed. Where an increase in ice-bulb temperature reduced the effectiveness of wind removing snow from the canopy.

-   Possible evidence here for thresholding behaviour below -3 deg. C where there is less liquid water in the canopy snow clumps and more suspeptible to wind induced unloadings. However we also have less frequency of observations here and may limit the interpretation of these results.
-   Less unloading and drip observed for above zero temperatures with wind speeds above 1 m/s which may be attributed to some evaporative cooling.
-   when its cold below we could use the sparse trough because it does not matter it leaks in these temps..

Removing periods above these thresholds, i.e., air temperature less than -6 °C and wind speed less than 2 m/s, shows that the probability of unloading increases based on the duration snow is intercepted in the canopy. The probability of unloading starts at around 0.5 when snow is newly intercepted in the canopy, followed by a decline to around 0.1 after about 10 hours, and following 24 hours the probability of unloading increases steeply up to near 1.0 at 100 hours.

### Modelling Canopy Snow Unloading 

Less confidence in the temperature unloading model, maybe better suited to use a physically based snowmelt model. The wind unloading model aligns well with the observations although, only two canopy snow load bins were used. This model is slightly less sensitive, with lower unloading rates at the same wind speeds compared to the @Roesch2001 relationships.

  mutate(model = 'wind_model')
temp_err_tbl <- readRDS('data/modelled_temp_unloading_error_table.rds') |> 
  mutate(model = 'temp_model')

rbind(wind_err_tbl, temp_err_tbl)

## Conclusions

-   Over two winter seasons, the primary processes contributing to canopy snow ablation were identified as unloading, drip, and sublimation. Wind redistribution of canopy snow was determined to be a negligible component of the mass balance. 
-   The probability of unloading was observed to increase with air temperature, wind speed, and the duration that snow is intercepted in the canopy. 
-   Exponential relationships were observed between both air temperature and wind speed with unloading and drip, which were also dependent on the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy. In comparison to existing models, this discontinuous forest exhibited unloading and drip due to warming at lower air temperatures. Conversely, wind-induced unloading occurred at higher wind speeds than predicted by current models.
