## Results 

### Unloading

Snow unloading was investigated during periods of time where snow was in the canopy and no above canopy precipitation was observed. Higher unloading rates were associated with high wind speed or high ice bulb temperature or a combination of both factors. Ice bulb temperature was observed to have a stronger relationship with unloading rates compared to air temperature since the ice bulb temperature is strongly related to sublimation and snowmelt rates which both influence the cohesion and adhesion of snow clumps in the canopy. There was also a negative association of ice-bulb temperature on wind speed. Where an increase in ice-bulb temperature reduced the effectiveness of wind removing snow from the canopy.

To describe the reduced wind induced snow unloading at warmer temperatures we can use a multivariate regression.

f \<- function(temp, wind, a, b1, b2, b3) {a \* exp(temp*b1)* exp(wind*b2)* exp(wind*temp*-b3)}

Below is using heavily filtered data, all of the observations of the ice bulb temp plot have low wind speeds and all of the obs in the within canopy wind speed plot have low temperatures. John suggested it would be better to use a multivariate regression here if possible.

## Conclusions 

-   The canopy snow ablation residual increased substantially with increasing wind speed and
is attributed to an associated increase in the wind resuspension and sublimation rates.
-   Observed unloading rates attributed to warming were higher at sub-zero temperatures when
the canopy was loaded compared to the HP98 and SA09 models.
-   The observed association between wind speed, canopy load and unloading was similar to
the RW01 model. However, at warmer temperatures wind induced unloading was reduced.
