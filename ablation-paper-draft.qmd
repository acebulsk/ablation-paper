## Introduction

![Example of the @Hedstrom1998a (HP98) and @Roesch2001 (RW01) parameterizations for the calculation of unloading and drip rates with increasing air temperature. Wind speed for the RW01 parameterization was set to zero. Note that the HP98 parameterization does not differentiate unloading processes (i.e., metamorphasism, wind-induced, melt) while the RW01 parameterization here calculates unloading and drip of canopy snow due to warming and melt alone and their wind-induced parameterization is shown separately.](figs/examples/unloading_drip_hp98_rw01.png){#fig-unl-ex-temp}

Here the air temperature has been set to a constant of -10°C to set the unloading rate due to warming to zero. The parameterization was run for a range of canopy snow loads (5, 10, 15, and 20 mm).](figs/examples/roesch_unloading.png){#fig-unl-ex-wind}

## Theory

@Roesch2001 proposed a parameterization to calculate the unloading and drip rate of snow intercepted in the canopy. The @Roesch2001 parameterization couples the unloading and drip rates into one equation. However, by isolating the wind-induced unloading function and using the @Storck2002 mass clump unloading parameterization (without drip) an unloading parameterization due to melt and wind can be developed as:

$$
q_{unld} = q_{unld}^{melt} + q_{unld}^{wind}
$$

where $q_{unld}^{wind}$ is the @Roech2001 method to unload snow as a function of wind speed and $q_{unld}^{melt}$ is the @Storck2002 method to unload mass clumps of snow due to melt. See @Cebulski2024b for a detailed description of the @Roesch2001 and @Storck2002 parameterizations.

## Methods

The SCLs measure $q_{unld}$ + $q_{drip}$ for periods where snow was intercepted in the canopy without atmospheric precipitation. During these periods the canopy snow mass balance could be simplified to: 

$$
\frac{dL}{dt} = - q_{unld}(L) - q_{drip}(L) - q_{wind}^{veg}(L) - q_{sub}^{veg}(L)
$$ {#eq-canopy-mass-bal}

the weighed tree lysimeter provided measurements of $\frac{dL}{dt}$ and thus a residual of the remaining unmeasured components provided an estimate of the $q_{wind}^{veg}(L)$ + $q_{sub}^{veg}(L)$ rates. A positive residual equates to canopy snow that was ablated and was not accounted for by measured $q_{unld}$ + $q_{drip}$. A negative residual occurred when higher rates of $q_{unld}$ + $q_{drip}$ was measured by the SCLs compared to what was ablated from the weighed tree. Slight differences in the mass balance at the SCL and weighed tree lysimeters were expected due to the different measurement locations.

To investigate the influence of individual processes on canopy snow unloading, the subcanopy lysimeters were used. The probability of unloading was calculated as:

$$
p_{unld} = \frac{n}{N}
$$

where $p_{unld}$ is the probability of unloading (-), $n$ is the number of unloading events that occurred in a particular met bin, and $N$ is the total number of occurrences of that met bin.

## Results

### Apportionment of Canopy Snow Ablation Processes

@fig-glob-unl-part shows that the measured unloading and drip rate was the dominant ablation process compared to simulated sublimation or the measured residual + error over two winter seasons. Simulated sublimation rates also make up a significant portion of canopy snow ablation and accounted for most of the residual measured ablation. This suggests that for the average conditions in this wind-exposed subalpine forest, wind redistribution of snow intercepted in the canopy is a relatively small component.

![](figs/results/canopy_snow_ablation_partition_global.png){#fig-glob-unl-part}

@fig-wind-temp-unl-part shows a large increase in the ablation residual with wind speeds above 3.5 m s^-1^ and little association with air temperature. The increase in the residual at high wind speeds is attributed to higher ablation rates measured by the weighed tree due which were not accounted for by corresponding increase in the unloading + drip rates. The difference between the residual + error term and the modelled sublimation rate is attributed to both an increase in horizontal wind redistribution of snow intercepted in the canopy and instrument error. Difficulties in measuring horizontal wind redistribution and quantify the instrument error limit the ability to partition the residual into these two processes. If it is assumed that the instrument error is constant across wind speeds, it could be determined that the increase in the residual + error term is primarily attributed to horizontal wind redistribution. However, since the sublimation parameterization in this simulation has not been tested in wind-exposed forest and may be an underestimate of true sublimation rates at high wind speeds. Therefore the increase in residual, compared to modelled sublimation could also be attributed to an increase in actual sublimation rate compared to the model. While these data could be used to parameterise a horizontal wind redistribution function, the uncertainty behind this residual term due to the aforementioned issues prove any resultant model to be too speculative.

### The Influence of Meteorology on Unloading

@fig-glob-prob-unl shows the association between the probability of unloading + drip with air temperature and wind speed. The probability of unloading + drip was found to be very high (close to 1) for air temperatures above 1 °C and above wind speeds of 2.5 m s^-1^. For wind speeds bins less than 1 m s^-1^ the probability of unloading was found to positively associated with air temperatures. However at higher wind speeds this association was observed to weaken, potentially due to some evaporative cooling. For air temperatures less than -6 °C a positive association between the probability of unloading + drip and wind speed was observed. Above -6 °C the reduced association between wind speed and probability of unloading + drip may be attributed to increased cohesion and adhesion of snow intercepted in the canopy attributed to an increase in liquid water content in the snow clumps. The low frequency of observations shown in @fig-glob-freq-unl, fow low and high air temperatures and wind speeds may limit the interpretation of these results.

![](figs/results/frequency_of_unloading_wind_air_temp.png){#fig-glob-freq-unl}
Removing periods above these thresholds, i.e., air temperature less than -6 °C and wind speed less than 2 m/s, shows that the probability of unloading increases based on the duration snow is intercepted in the canopy. The probability of unloading starts at around 0.5 when snow is newly intercepted in the canopy, followed by a decline to around 0.1 after about 10 hours, and following 24 hours the probability of unloading increases steeply up to near 1.0 at 100 hours.

### Modelling Canopy Snow Unloading 

Less confidence in the temperature unloading model, maybe better suited to use a physically based snowmelt model. The wind unloading model aligns well with the observations although, only two canopy snow load bins were used. This model is slightly less sensitive, with lower unloading rates at the same wind speeds compared to the @Roesch2001 relationships.

  mutate(model = 'wind_model')

  mutate(model = 'temp_model')

rbind(wind_err_tbl, temp_err_tbl)

```

## Conclusions

-   Over two winter seasons, the primary processes contributing to canopy snow ablation were identified as unloading, drip, and sublimation. Wind redistribution of canopy snow was determined to be a negligible component of the mass balance. 
-   The probability of unloading was observed to increase with air temperature, wind speed, and the duration that snow is intercepted in the canopy. 
-   Exponential relationships were observed between both air temperature and wind speed with unloading and drip, which were also dependent on the amount of snow intercepted in the canopy. In comparison to existing models, this discontinuous forest exhibited unloading and drip due to warming at lower air temperatures. Conversely, wind-induced unloading occurred at higher wind speeds than predicted by current models.
