2021-12-14 17:15:00,2021-12-18 12:00:00,,1,1,,,no time lapse imagery here
2021-12-19 16:30:00,2021-12-21 11:00:00,,3,1,,,outlier very old snow from around 10 days ago still in tree.. small increment of snow interrupted the previous event... not affected by 5ms wind speed
2021-12-27 08:30:00,2021-12-28 07:00:00,,1,1,,,likely includes some wind redistribution
2021-12-29 12:45:00,2021-12-29 22:30:00,,1,1,,,
2021-12-30 00:45:00,2022-01-01 14:45:00,,1,1,,,long cold event with minimal unloading
2022-01-04 09:15:00,2022-01-06 08:30:00,,1,3,,,tree is mostly loading here
2022-01-06 17:30:00,2022-01-06 23:30:00,,3,1,,,troughs dont align with weighed tree loss
2022-01-09 04:00:00,2022-01-11 08:30:00,,1,3,,,"Following significant snowfall mixing with unloading, just the remaining few clumps left in this event."
2022-01-18 07:45:00,2022-01-21 23:00:00,,1,1,mixed,,tree lost a lot more than troughts likely okay due to high sublimation and wind redistribution
2022-02-01 10:15:00,2022-02-04 12:00:00,,3,3,,,do not include snowing while unloading
2022-02-03 04:30:00,2022-02-04 02:45:00,,1,1,,,shorter period inbetween snowfall
2022-02-04 05:00:00,2022-02-04 15:00:00,,1,1,,,shorter period inbetween snowfall
2022-02-21 02:00:00,2022-02-23 19:30:00,,1,1,closed,,
2022-02-24 12:00:00,2022-02-27 05:45:00,,1,1,mixed,,
2022-03-02 00:45:00,2022-03-02 19:15:00,,1,1,,,short period here and lots of wind going on
2022-03-04 22:15:00,2022-03-05 19:15:00,,1,1,closed,,massive sublimation near the end of this event not captured by crhm modelled sublimation
2022-03-06 03:45:00,2022-03-07 12:45:00,,1,3,,,weighed tree spiked during this event due to tower lowering so no weighed tree data for sublimation calculation
2022-03-07 23:30:00,2022-03-08 15:15:00,,3,3,,,incremental precip during 
2022-03-09 02:45:00,2022-03-10 23:00:00,,1,1,,,ended before precip starts as high winds cause noise in lysimeters
2022-03-16 11:00:00,2022-03-19 20:00:00,,1,1,,1,mostly sublimation but confirmed drip insitu on notesa and big mass clump unloading here associated with warming and sublimation
2022-03-20 01:45:00,2022-03-21 03:00:00,,1,1,,,
2022-03-24 09:45:00,2022-03-26 16:00:00,,1,1,mixed,,"very impressive sublimation event here, no unloading observed in troughs or in timelapse imagery, very clear sublimation of canopy snow"
2022-03-29 08:45:00,2022-03-29 19:00:00,,1,1,,,another possible sublimation event
2022-04-05 19:30:00,2022-04-06 17:30:00,,1,3,,,too small less than 1 mm 
2022-04-21 04:30:00,2022-04-22 00:15:00,,1,1,closed,,significant ablation observed by the tree but not in the troughs so must be maily sublimation here
2022-04-23 08:00:00,2022-04-23 20:00:00,,1,1,closed,,"smaller event, some rime ice right before this event starts"
2022-05-09 09:00:00,2022-05-10 18:00:00,,3,1,,1,incremental precip during event so cannot filter out snowfall evidence of drip here in situ
2022-05-20 21:15:00,2022-05-22 14:00:00,,3,1,,1,most of the snow unloads while it is snowing prior to the start of this event
2022-06-14 22:45:00,2022-06-15 22:45:00,,3,1,,1,"all snow out of the tree once the precip starts, will have to think about how to analyze this"
2022-06-23 14:00:00,2022-06-23 17:30:00,,1,1,,1,everything seems okay just getting less unloading to troughs compared to tree it looks like
2022-06-24 12:45:00,2022-06-24 16:00:00,,1,1,,,everything seems okay just getting less unloading to troughs compared to tree it looks like
2022-10-23 07:00:00,2022-10-24 03:15:00,,1,3,,,weighed tree dead still so wont have corresponding sublimation data
2022-10-25 10:00:00,2022-10-26 14:00:00,,1,3,,,weighed tree dead still so wont have corresponding sublimation data
2022-10-28 15:45:00,2022-10-30 15:45:00,,1,3,,,weighed tree dead still so wont have corresponding sublimation data
2022-10-31 20:15:00,2022-11-01 03:30:00,,1,3,,,weighed tree dead still so wont have corresponding sublimation data

2022-11-07 19:15:00,2022-11-16 09:00:00,,1,3,,,weighed tree dead still so wont have corresponding sublimation data
2022-11-28 02:30:00,2022-11-30 03:15:00,,1,3,,,
2022-12-01 15:15:00,2022-12-04 22:15:00,,1,1,,,pluvio shows some inc in precip here but I confirmed on the timelapse imagery that we have blue sky so must have been snow blowing into the clearing 
2022-12-06 22:30:00,2022-12-08 22:30:00,,1,1,,,looks like some evidence of rime ice occuring on the timelapse imagery over this time period
2022-12-19 02:15:00,2022-12-20 06:15:00,,3,3,,,tree loading here not sure whats going on 
2022-12-21 13:15:00,2022-12-23 05:30:00,,1,3,,,bad tree but some good unloading obs
2023-01-28 05:45:00,2023-02-02 10:00:00,,1,1,,,incremental precip during this interval but blue skies observed on timelapse imagery so possibly snow redistribution into pluvio
2023-02-24 06:15:00,2023-02-24 20:00:00,,1,1,,,pluvio shows snow over this time interval but non obsreved in timelapse imagery so could be some riming or blowing snow redistribution still a bit of snow in the tree at the end here but does not unload even with further big wind gusts so potentially some threshold effect here where a small amout of old snow has a harder time unloading as opposed to a larger amount of old snow
2023-02-26 20:45:00,2023-02-27 06:00:00,,1,3,,,stopping at the end of this event due to 1 mm fresh snowfall
2023-02-27 10:45:00,2023-02-28 04:00:00,,1,3,,,new event split up from previous long event which included some precip
2023-02-28 11:00:00,2023-02-28 16:00:00,,1,3,,,maybe 1mm rime accumulation here on the weighed tree 
2023-03-01 21:00:00,2023-03-02 10:45:00,,1,3,,,new event which seemed to have just been missed
2023-03-02 22:30:00,2023-03-03 12:15:00,,1,1,,,new event which seemed to have just been missed
2023-03-04 01:00:00,2023-03-04 17:00:00,,1,1,,,new event which seemed to have just been missed
2023-03-06 11:00:00,2023-03-07 20:00:00,,1,1,mixed,,new event which seemed to have just been missed
2023-03-14 11:00:00,2023-03-18 21:30:00,,1,1,,1,a bit of drip near the end of this event
2023-03-25 05:00:00,2023-03-25 13:15:00,,1,1,mixed,1,below zero but some mass unloading due to warming and lowish winds
2023-03-25 14:30:00,2023-03-25 20:00:00,,1,1,mixed,1,
2023-03-26 00:15:00,2023-03-26 21:30:00,,1,1,mixed,1,below zero but some mass unloading due to warming and lowish winds
2023-03-27 18:30:00,2023-03-28 07:45:00,,1,1,,,some riming after this event maybe > 5mm as no precip observed in pluvio or timelapse or lysimeters but tree increases substantially
2023-03-28 09:15:00,2023-03-31 18:30:00,,1,1,mixed,1,very long event with refreezing overnight and melt during the day
2023-04-03 10:00:00,2023-04-06 05:00:00,,1,1,closed,1,this was cut off early before as 5 mm of precip observed at PWL pluvio but this must have been some snow caked to the rim as no precip observed at FRS or timelapse or lysimeters
2023-04-12 21:30:00,2023-04-16 12:30:00,,1,1,,1,had to split into 3 events due to small convective precip breaking up large snowfall event that preceeds this
2023-04-16 13:30:00,2023-04-16 18:15:00,,3,,,,troughs loosing water here as are close to full and measure much less than TBs had to split into 3 events due to small convective precip breaking up large snowfall event that preceeds this
2023-04-17 12:30:00,2023-04-17 23:00:00,,1,1,,,medium trough close to full
2023-05-08 08:15:00,2023-05-08 14:45:00,,1,1,,1,temps above 0 deg celcius added this for tipping bucket analysis.. sparse trough leaks do not use
2023-06-15 07:00:00,2023-06-15 12:00:00,,1,1,closed,1,only medium trough good here 
2023-06-21 06:00:00,2023-06-21 10:15:00,,1,1,mixed,1,keep a close eye on medium trough here as looks close to full
