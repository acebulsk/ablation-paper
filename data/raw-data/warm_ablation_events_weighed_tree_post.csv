"# the unloading_start_date corresponds to the start time the weighed tree starts ablating... did not filter out as carefully for precip here so dont use for ablation paramaterisations, and the end date by looking at the end of the weighed tree response. quality corresponds to if the event should be used 1 is good 999 should notbe used.

2022-03-16 09:45:00,2022-03-17 20:00:00,1,0,on the colder side but have insitu notes of observed drip on the 17th
2022-04-21 08:00:00,2022-04-21 18:00:00,1,0,significant ablation observed by the tree but not in the troughs so must be maily sublimation here
2022-04-23 08:00:00,2022-04-23 19:30:00,2,0,"smaller event, some rime ice right before this event starts"
2022-05-09 09:00:00,2022-05-10 18:00:00,2,0,incremental precip during event so cannot filter out snowfall evidence of drip here in situ  temperature barely above 0 during this event and incremental precip over event still some snow left in the canopy at the end of the event

2022-06-24 11:45:00,2022-06-24 17:30:00,1,1,interesting looking at the weighed tree here although have increase in precip weight of tree is maintained by equal ish ablation.. trough medium and dense good here.. tb1 and tb4 read very little here maybe blocked with material?
2022-10-23 07:00:00,,999,0,tipping buckets not repaired yet from summer damage

2022-10-28 15:45:00,,999,0,tipping buckets not repaired yet from summer damage
2022-10-31 20:15:00,,3,0,nothing recorded by tipping buckets here probably too cold
2022-11-02 14:30:00,2022-11-02 13:15:00,3,0,significant snow in tipping buckets likely from snowfall starting on oct 30 also temps mainly below 0 so may not be tipping properly in the shade
2022-11-28 02:30:00,,3,0,temps below 0 no tips observed
2023-03-14 11:00:00,2023-03-18 21:00:00,1,0,temps below 0 melt observed on timelapse
2023-03-25 11:15:00,2023-03-25 19:30:00,1,0,below zero but some mass unloading due to warming and lowish winds  temps below 0 melt observed on timelapse
2023-03-26 10:45:00,2023-03-26 23:45:00,1,0,below zero but some mass unloading due to warming and lowish winds
2023-03-28 10:00:00,2023-03-28 20:00:00,1,0,some riming after this event maybe > 5mm as no precip observed in pluvio or timelapse or lysimeters but tree increases substantially
2023-03-29 09:15:00,2023-03-29 21:00:00,1,1,very long event with refreezing overnight and melt during the day  could combine with above but not much happening at night
2023-04-03 10:00:00,2023-04-03 12:15:00,1,0,temps below 0 during event and then melts out afterward

2023-05-08 07:45:00,2023-05-08 14:45:00,1,1,temps above 0 deg celcius added this for tipping bucket analysis.. sparse trough leaks do not use
2023-06-15 07:00:00,2023-06-15 11:45:00,1,1,gets noisey near the end here
